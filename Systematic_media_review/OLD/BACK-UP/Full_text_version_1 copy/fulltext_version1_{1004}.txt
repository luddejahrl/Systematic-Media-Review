New furniture in our already Beautiful Lodge. Upgrades are happening in the rooms of the inn!

Reel Inn and Lodge has a private patio for grilling or if you’re staying in one of our 8 fish themed rooms we have an outdoor seating area with gas BBQ grills, picnic tables and a beverage machine.

Besides location, the number one compliment we get is the cleanliness of the rooms. We have a manager on the premises to answer questions in a timely manner.





The rooms are currently being upgraded with many upgrades already in place. Don’t miss this great new and unique vacation experience.
