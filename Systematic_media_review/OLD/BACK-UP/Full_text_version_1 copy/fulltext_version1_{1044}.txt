For fans of costumed comic book crimefighters, intergalactic odysseys, old school action serials, and creepy cinematic classics, 2023 is going to be a very important year at the cinema. Admittedly, those types of stories can be found all the time, but they especially describe the movies coming next year.

Of course, there are more than just upcoming superhero movies (including new Marvel movies) to look forward to, as well as upcoming horror movies, too. Let's go through all of the 2023 new movie releases we have confirmed so far, starting in January.
