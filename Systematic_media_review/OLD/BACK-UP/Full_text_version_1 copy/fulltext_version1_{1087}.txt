International Education Database

The purpose of the international education database is to measure and rank the impact of each nation’s education system on its economic and social environment.

The database will also serve as a public center to survey, evaluate, and document the progress of educational goals set as part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal Initiative (2015 to 2030).
