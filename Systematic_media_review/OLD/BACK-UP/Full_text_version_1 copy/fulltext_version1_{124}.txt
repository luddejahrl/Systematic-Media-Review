Jan 1990 During the first week of this month, gunmen in Jaffna, northern Sri Lanka, killed 30 teenagers. The victims were generally those who showed an affiliation to Tamil militant groups loyal to the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) in the country. Jaffna has been the scene of bloody confrontations between the anti-IPKF Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the pro-Indian Tamil National Army (TNA), the military wing of the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), which is the ruling party of the temporarily-merged north-eastern provincial council. The TNA was created to fill the vacuum after the IPKF pullout. Indian troops abruptly pulled out of the Tamil stronghold of Jaffna peninsula, leaving the town to the Tigers that they had battled for two years. The evacuation of Jaffna leaves only one major town still patrolled by the IPKF -- the port of Trincomalee, 147 miles northeast of Colombo. The Indian departure from Trincomalee is expected to trigger a power struggle within the Tamil movement, as Trincomalee is the base of several pro-Indian Tamil groups who are fiercely opposed by the Tigers. These groups captured control of the provincial council in an election boycotted by the LTTE, which is now staking its claim to political power and wants new elections called (XNS, 01/09/90 & 01/10/90).

Mar 1990 Members of the EPRLF will not accede to the request of Foreign Minister R. Wijeratne to lay down arms, according to its leader V. Perumal, the just-dismissed Chief Minister of the north-east provincial council. On March 1, Perumal's first action as Chief Minister was a unilateral declaration of independence. Perumal stated that, "The government of Sri Lanka will have to recognize the Democratic Republic of Eelam as a separate state". The Sri Lankan government has ignored the unilateral declaration of independence and has proposed the dissolution of the provincial council. Perumal left for India with his family in a special Indian aircraft. India has indicated that it "does not support any call for Eelam (independent state) in any form" (XNS, 03/04/90). Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister welcomed the reported decision of Indian Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi to refuse entry to 3,000 cadres of the TNA. The ship carrying the TNA militia is reported to be on its way back to Sri Lanka (XNS, 03/08/90). 2,000 Indian soldiers, the last group of an original force of 50,000, returned home after a controversial 32-month stay.

May 1990 The LTTE had called for a hartal (strike) to demonstrate solidarity with striking Indian Tamil tea plantation workers in the central highlands. Most worrying to the government and the Sinhalese majority was the reason for the strike rather than its success. The plantation workers have little in common with the separatist Tamils. They are Indian Tamil workers, some of whom are not Sri Lankan citizens. The government recently decided to repatriate 100,000 Indian Tamils under a 1975 agreement with India. In response, the Up-Country Plantation Workers Union launched a protest strike. Its leader was arrested and the Tigers saw the opportunity to widen their base among the Indian Tamils.

Jun 1990 The Chief Minister of the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu offered to provide medical aid to Tamil militants wounded in fighting against Sri Lanka's security forces. The Chief Minister did not make it clear whether he supported a charge by the Tigers that napalm was being used, but he said: "In the war...the Sri Lankan forces must avoid situations in which they rain napalm bombs on their own people" (Reuters, 06/27/90). New Delhi promised to try to prevent more civilian deaths in Sri Lanka's escalating violence.

Jul 1990 Ethnic loyalties are reported to be wearing thin in India's Tamil Nadu province, as yet again, boatloads of Sri Lankan Tamils are seeking refuge from the latest outbreak of civil warfare. At least 20,000 refugees have made the 20-mile voyage across the Palk Strait to India since the LTTE launched attacks on Sri Lankan forces last month. In 1983, Tamils in India took to the streets in support of their Sri Lankan kin. 14 members of the EPRLF and one civilian died in a gun battle in Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu, India. Refugee leader Chandrahasan blames the LTTE for undermining sympathy in its bloody drive for supremacy among the Tamil militant groups. "Indian governments aren't in sympathy with our movement because they fear it will spread separatism through the subcontinent", said one Tamil nationalist (Reuters, 07/17/90). In eastern Sri Lanka hundreds of Muslims have fled their homes after rebels massacred 168 Muslims traveling with a food convoy. November: Tamil rebels are obtaining weapons from southern India, Sri Lankan Deputy Defense Minister R. Wijeratne said in Parliament (Reuters, 11/29/90).

Jan 1991 India's Foreign Minister promised to never again send troops to intervene in the conflict between Colombo and Tamil separatist rebels. Radicals from both the Sinhala majority, the Janata Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), and the Tamil minority, the LTTE, refused to accept the 1987 Indo-Sri Lankan Accord. The Tigers fought against the Indians killing about 1,200 soldiers and wounding 3,000 during the IPKF's 32 months of operation before its withdrawal last March by the new non-Congress government. The Indian government withdrew following repeated calls to do so from the new Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was against the agreement (Reuters, 01/29/91).

May 1991 On May 21, former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was killed by a suicide bomber -- a young woman -- during an election rally in a rural enclave south of Madras. Gandhi was Prime Minister from 1984, following his mother's assassination, until 1989. Responding to the demands of some Tamil politicians, India's Law and Justice Minister, S. Swamy, says his country will not deport Sri Lankans because of the suspected involvement of Tamil militants in the assassination (AFP, 05/27/91). As the word spread that Gandhi's killer was a Sri Lankan Tamil, the exile Tamil population was seized with fear. There are about 210,000 Sri Lankan Tamils in Tamil Nadu state (The New York Times, 05/31/91).

Jun 1991 While investigating the assassination of Gandhi, one senior official in Madras stated that, "It is now established beyond doubt that the LTTE did it" (Reuters, 06/13/91). The LTTE has denied assassinating Gandhi, whom it viewed as an enemy of Tamil separatism.

Jul 1991 Indian police have arrested about 2,000 Sri Lankan Tamils in Tamil Nadu after the lapse of a deadline for them to register with the police. The goal of the operation was to separate the militants from the refugees.

Aug 1991 Some Tamil groups who are fighting alongside the Sri Lankan army against the LTTE have asked to take part in the proposed peace talks between the government and the LTTE. This comes in the wake of the declaration by S. Thondaman, the sole Tamil Minister, to act as the negotiator between the two sides. Sri Kantha of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and Kandasamy of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), both former rebel groups who are bitterly opposed to the LTTE, expressed concern at the possibility of the LTTE taking advantage of another ceasefire proposed by the government (XNS, 08/26/91).

Sep 1991 The Indian probe into Rajiv Gandhi's killing is demolishing a vital base of the leading suspects -- the LTTE. Police have unearthed arms and explosives caches, closed illicit weapons factories, unraveled smuggling rings and destroyed the Tiger's communications network in Tamil Nadu. Some Sri Lankan MPs have demanded the immediate resignation of President Premadasa, following his admission that the armed forces were cooperating with the LTTE to fight the pro-Indian TNA in the northeast before secret talks between Colombo and the Tigers collapsed in June last year (Reuters, 09/02/91).

Nov 1991 Tamil rebels have reportedly acquired at least three surface-to-air missiles, based on records found in a boat captured by the navy.

Jan 1992 The repatriation of Tamil refugees is continuing, with the second group leaving for home from Madras. The refugees are among the 30,000 Sri Lankan Tamils who have volunteered to return. The process began after the visit of the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister to New Delhi earlier this month.

Feb 1992 The Sri Lankan government is reportedly indicating that plans for the recruitment of Tamils into the military and the establishment of a predominantly Tamil police force for the northeast were not implemented because of renewed hostilities in 1990 and a lack of suitable candidates (US State Dept. Dispatch, 02/92). The Buddhist clergy have become extremely vocal in the debate over whether to fight Tamil separatists or negotiate with them. One leading monk, the Venerable Rahulla, said, "Until this war is successfully concluded, no peace talks should be held". The monks are also angry about a set of peace proposals, formulated by S. Thondaman, Chairman of the CWC, who is believed by the monks to be planning for a larger south Indian domination of their country (The Independent, 02/07/92). In 1959, Solomon Bandaranaike, the then popular Prime Minister, was killed by a Buddhist monk while he was initiating new policies regarding Tamil minorities.

May 1992 India has declared a ban on the operations of the LTTE within its territory. The Interior Minister said India would ask Sri Lanka to extradite LTTE supremo Prabhakaran and other Tigers accused of masterminding Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. The Minister said the LTTE was plotting "the separation of Tamil Nadu from India and encouraging chauvinistic groups in Tamil Nadu to openly preach secession and engage in unlawful activities" (Reuters, 05/14/92).

Jun 1992 Seven Tamil parties are now discussing proposals to work out a common stand to find a political settlement to the ethnic conflict. The current engagement of Tamil parties including the CWC (a coalition partner of the government) and the EPRLF (which governed the semi-autonomous provincial council two years ago), is seen as a significant move in view of the resumption of activities by an all-party parliamentary committee. This is seen as a step towards seeking a united Tamil approach to formulate a peace package, which is likely to go before a parliamentary committee set up to forge a national consensus. The parliamentary select committee, set up by S. Thondaman, is expected to meet by the end of the month to discuss a 4-point peace package that includes: the permanent merger of the northern and eastern provinces with a dominant population of Tamils, the meaningful devolution that signifies autonomy for the merged province, institutional arrangements to safeguard the rights of the Muslims in the north and east, guarantees to ensure that the Sinhala minority in those areas enjoy the same rights as minorities in Sinhala provinces (XNS, 06/21/92).

Dec 1992 The Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) announced that five parties in Sri Lanka, including the two major national parties, have agreed on setting up two separate councils for the north and the east in a bid to solve the ethnic crisis. According to the agreement by the ruling UNP, the opposition SLFP, the Muslim Congress, the Communist Party and the Samasamaja Party, the north and east of the island will be treated as two distinct provinces in a scheme of devolution similar to India's administration of its states. However, the two members of the 45-member committee representing 6 Tamil parties and the members of the CWC did not agree with the scheme. Most of the Tamil members of the committee dissented, as the majority rejected the idea of merging the north and eastern provinces into one administrative province (XNS, 12/17/92). S. Thondaman, the Chairman of the Ceylon Workers' Congress, resigned from the PSC, stating that it failed to appreciate the aspirations of minority Tamils concentrated in the northeast, which comprises about one-third of Sri Lanka. Tamil parties including the LTTE claim the northeast as traditional Tamil homelands whose demographic patterns they assert successive governments have changed by state-aided colonization schemes.

Jan 1993 The Indian Navy denied its involvement in the death of Kittu, the Second in Command of the LTTE, claiming he had committed suicide. Kittu died last month along with nine other Tigers when their ship went up in flames after being seized by Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean. P. Neduraman, the President of the India-based Tamil National Movement, condemned the incident (Reuters, 01/15/93).

May 1993 President Ranasinghe Premadasa and two dozen others were killed by a Tamil suicide bomber during the May Day parade. This followed the murder of Lalith Athulathmudali, the President's chief rival and leader of the opposition Democratic United National Front, which split last year from the ruling United National Party (UNP). Prime Minister Dingiri Wijetunga has taken over as the country's President. Sri Lanka's provincial elections were held on May 17 with unusual calmness. Voter turnout was close to 75% in comparison to 50% in 1988. The ruling United National Party (UNP) won in 4 provinces. The leftist alliance, the People's United Front, led by Srimavo Bandaranaike won two provinces, including the Western province that covers Colombo. No elections were held in the northern and eastern provinces, as it was judged that the Tamil Tigers would disrupt them.

Nov 1993 In a major operation, the Tigers stormed an army base in the north, killing at least 200 soldiers and capturing much valuable equipment.

Jan 1994 The long-delayed trial of 41 people accused of plotting the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi opened on January 19 in a prison courtroom in Madras, India. The prosecution alleges that the LTTE feared Gandhi's Congress party would win the elections and renew India's backing of a Sri Lanka government dominated by the Sinhalese majority (Reuters, 01/19/94). Of the 41 people on trial, 29 are Sri Lankan Tamils. The rest are from Tamil Nadu, home to 50 million Indian Tamils.

Mar 1994 The ruling UNP has witnessed its first big electoral defeat in 17 years. The party, which is preparing for a presidential election later this year and a general election in early 1995, was heavily defeated in provincial council polls in the southern province. The party won just 23 seats, against 32 for the opposition SLFP led by Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The result was widely seen as a vote against the policies of President D.B. Wijetunga, who championed a hard-line approach to the Tamil Tigers (Financial Times, 03/29/94).

Aug 1994 The left leaning five-party People's Alliance, led by Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the daughter of Srimavo Bandaranaike, won 105 seats to the ruling UNP's 94 in parliamentary elections. The other 26 seats in the 225-seat parliament went to minority Hindu and Muslim parties. Although Tamil rebels boycotted the elections, they pledged support for the new government of Mrs. Kumaratunga who took office with an offer of unconditional direct negotiations with the LTTE.

Sep 1994 In a rare interview with a BBC reporter, LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran urged the government to declare a ceasefire and create a climate for peace negotiations to end the civil war (Reuters, 09/13/94).

Oct 1994 The government has declared a state of emergency after a bomb blast killed the opposition presidential candidate G. Dissanayke and several top leaders of the UNP during a campaign meeting. At least 50 people died and 200 were injured in the blast believed to be detonated by a suicide bomber. The LTTE has denied involvement in the killing, but the rebels have always viewed Dissanayke as the chief architect of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord of 1987, which was aimed at crushing the Tamil rebellion.

Nov 1994 With a pledge to curtail the power of presidency, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike won a decisive victory in presidential elections. She captured about 62% of the votes including many votes from Muslims and Tamils. The rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire for a week to mark Bandaranaike's inauguration. Twenty policemen and five civilians have been killed in two landmine blasts, staged by the suspected Maoist Peoples' War Group (PWG) in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The PWG, the remnant of a former peasant movement against landlords, reportedly has links with the LTTE (AFP, 11/29/94).

Jan 1995 Suspected Tamil rebels have shot dead the leader of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). The PLOTE was among several former separatist Tamil groups that gave up their armed struggle in favor of parliamentary politics after India became actively involved in 1987 through the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord.

Feb 1995 About 500 Sri Lankan Tamils arrived in northern Mannar port; they are the first group of refugees to return from India since the repatriation process was suspended six months ago. The refugees are among the 8,000 who have agreed to be repatriated. About 100,000 refugees still remain in India.

Mar 1995 The rebels have spurned a French offer to mediate peace talks, Sri Lankan President Kumaratunga stated while on her first official visit to New Delhi (AP Worldstream, 03/27/95).

Apr 1995 Tamil rebels are expecting a government ministerial team for peace talks in their Jaffna stronghold on April 10. The government of President Kumaratunga initiated peace talks with the LTTE last October. However, the talks were stalled because of some new demands by the LTTE, such as the removal of army camps from Jaffna, the complete lifting of an economic embargo and a relaxation of a ban on night fishing. The LTTE leader extended the negotiating deadline from March 28 to April 19.

Apr 23, 1995 The LTTE has broken a 14-week ceasefire with the government by launching a number of attacks during the past week. A Tiger suicide squad attacked two naval vessels in the eastern port of Trincomalee, killing 12 soldiers. The Tigers are reported to be the only insurgent group in the world that has its own navy. Also, a military base was ambushed in eastern Batticaloa district; 25 troops were killed while rebel casualties are unknown. During peace talks, the LTTE and the People's Alliance government of President Kumaratunga agreed to a truce which had held since January 8. The Tigers claim they broke the ceasefire because the government had not met their demands by the April 19th deadline. Authorities had agreed to lift an economic embargo on Jaffna and relaxed regulations on night fishing; however, the LTTE also wants any Jaffna army camps dismantled and free movement for armed fighters in the east (Reuters, 04/23/95).

Apr 30, 1995 For the first time in the 12-year civil war, Tamil rebels used anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down two air force transport plans. All 94 people on board died. Since the LTTE broke a ceasefire, over 160 troops have been killed. The United States is scheduled to send a team of instructors to Sri Lanka next month to help train the army, which is under strain due to equipment and manpower shortages (Reuters, 04/30/95).

May 1995 Sri Lanka says it is still committed to peace negotiations with Tamil rebels; however, it hasn't made any recent overtures (Reuters, 05/05/95).

May 5, 1995 India's External Affairs Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, says that the Tamil insurgency in Sri Lanka is an internal problem. Mukherjee also denied recent rumors that the Sri Lankan government had asked India for military aid to help combat the Tigers (Reuters, 05/05/95).

May 10, 1995 Small political parties and those that represent ethnic minorities are worried that proposed electoral reforms could reduce their presence in Parliament. A parliamentary committee is currently considering reforms such as a mixture of proportional representation and the first-past-the-post system. Some analysts indicate that the changes are needed to ensure that ethnic minorities are properly represented (Reuters, 05/10/95).

May 16, 1995 Government and military sources indicate that in the month since the LTTE broke the ceasefire, well over 400 people have been killed. 181 rebels have died while another 250 have been wounded. The military has lost over 250 troops. Most of the clashes have occurred in eastern Trincomalee district (Reuters, 05/16/95).

May 17, 1995 Three human rights commissions appointed by President Kumaratunga when she took office last November are trying to heal old wounds by acknowledging the disappearances of tens of thousands of people. They are now focusing on mechanisms to punish the guilty and compensate relatives. Between 20 and 60,000 people disappeared from 1988-1990 during an armed rebellion by the left-wing Sinhalese movement, the JVP or People's Liberation Army (Reuters, 05/17/95).

May 24, 1995 At least 30 soldiers, 20 LTTE members, and three civilians were killed in three separate incidents in Batticaloa during the past week. Western governments including Britain have condemned the recent Tiger attacks, while praising the government's efforts to seek a political solution to the conflict (Reuters, 05/24/95).

Jun 1995 Sri Lanka plans to establish a human rights task force that will monitor arrests and detention facilities. The move follows criticism from Western governments and human rights groups about abuses perpetuated by the country's security forces. Tamil political parties have also recently asked the President to ensure that innocent Tamils are not harassed during search operations (Reuters, 06/01/95).

Jun 2, 1995 The independent human rights group, The Law and Society Trust, states that gross human rights violations (e.g. disappearances and unlawful killings) decreased in Sri Lanka in 1994 (Reuters, 06/02/95).

Jun 3, 1995 A 12-year old girl died when at least nine homes belonging to Indian Tamils on a tea estate in Galle district were torched. A curfew had been declared in Galle the previous day after a mob attacked Tamil shops. Tamil residents have taken refuge in temples; a Tamil MP contends that the police only responded once most of the damage had been done. Army and navy reinforcements have been called in. The attacks against the Indian Tamils are reported to be in response to last week's murder of a leading Buddhist monk who was an active opponent of the LTTE. Meanwhile, thousands of Sinhalese families are reported to be fleeing the eastern region fearing retribution from the Tigers (Reuters, 06/03/95, 06/05/95).

Jun 3, 1995 Military sources state that a two-day offensive against a Tiger hideout near Trincomalee resulted in the deaths of 110 rebels. Ten soldiers died during the assault (Reuters, 06/03/95).

Jun 3, 1995 India has asked Sri Lanka to extradite the leader of the LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran. The Indian government charges that Prabhakaran masterminded the May 1991 assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Gandhi was blown up by a suspected female Tiger during a rally in Madras, the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu (Reuters, 06/03/95).

Jun 7, 1995 Tourism to Sri Lanka is on the rise, despite a recent bombing at the country's international airport. The Tourist Board reports a 15% increase from the previous year. No casualties were reported in the first Tiger attack outside the northeast since April (Reuters, 06/07/95).

Jun 13, 1995 Authorities indicate that at least 44 people have been killed in Batticaloa district in two separate attacks by the Tamil Tigers (Reuters, 06/13/95).

Jun 15, 1995 President Kumaratunga has issued special instructions to the police and armed forces to respect human rights. Included are directives on the treatment of women and children, informing detainees why they are being held and allowing them to communicate in the language of their choice (Reuters, 06/15/95).

Jun 21, 1995 Frank Wisner, the US Ambassador to India, says that Washington will not allow the sale of weapons to the LTTE. The US listed the Tigers as a "terrorist group" when it broke a ceasefire in April (Reuters, 06/21/95).

Jul 1995 Twenty-five unidentified bodies were discovered in Bolgoda Lake and northwestern Kurunegala district during a three-week period in May and June. The Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) asserts that the victims could be Tamil youths who were reported missing in Trincomalee district and Colombo. The bodies were found with their hands tied and bore evidence of torture (Reuters, 07/03/95).

Jul 4, 1995 Amnesty International is calling on the Sri Lankan government to investigate claims that at least 19 civilians were murdered by security forces in the northeast in May. Some killings reportedly occurred during search operations while others were allegedly retribution for Tiger attacks. Tamil groups fear that death squads that were prominent during the JVP insurgency are now back in business (Reuters, 07/04/95).

Jul 9, 1995 The army has launched Operation Leap Forward in the country's north in order to combat the LTTE (Reuters, 07/15/95).

Jul 15, 1995 In two bombing incidents and a Tamil attack on Mandaithivu Island in the first two weeks of July, around 110 soldiers, 50 rebels and 5 civilians were reported killed (Reuters, 07/01/95, 07/07/95).

Jul 15, 1995 The Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDF), a former militant group, is threatening to quit Parliament (and thus withdraw its support of the People's Alliance) unless the military halts a major offensive in the north. The EPDF's threat follows the recent bombing of a church at Navali, just north of Jaffna, in which 121 civilians were killed. Mothers and Daughters of Sri Lanka, a coalition of 18 women's organizations, also called for a cessation of the military assault (Reuters, 07/15/95).

Aug 1995 President Chandrika Kumaratunga has announced a new devolution proposal aimed at ending the Sri Lankan Tamil insurgency. Under the plan, the country would be divided into eight administrative regions which would have control over key areas such as land, finance, and law and order. The north and eastern areas, where the indigenous Tamils are concentrated, would be merged into one region, fulfilling a demand long pressed for by the Tamil Tigers. Rural Industrial Development Minister S. Thondaman, an Indian Tamil, has, however, criticized the plan. He demanded that power in the northeast be given to the LTTE who should be given five years to restore democratic institutions. Kumaratunga rejected Thondaman's demand, stating there will be no more talks with the LTTE. The plan is to be included in a new constitution that is set to be drawn up by the end of the year (Agence France Presse, 08/03/95).

Aug 7, 1995 An Indian Tamil was identified as the suicide bomber who set off a cartload of explosives near Columbo's landmark Independence Memorial Hall. 22 people were killed while more than 40 were wounded. The Indian Tamil bomber was reported to be a member of the LTTE. The attack has been described as the LTTE's response to the President's recent devolution proposal (Reuters, 08/07/95).

Aug 8, 1995 Police indicate that the target of yesterday's suicide bombing was a motorcade either carrying the President or her Deputy Defense Minister. It is unclear why the Indian Tamil bomber detonated the explosives before reaching his target (Reuters, 08/08/95).

Aug 11, 1995 In a letter sent to the Reuters News Agency, the Ellalan Force, which is reported to be part of the LTTE, claimed responsibility for this week's bombing in Colombo. The letter also threatened to halt tourism and foreign investment unless Operation Leap Forward was terminated (Reuters, 08/11/95).

Aug 11, 1995 An international coalition, the NGO Consortium on Relief and Rehabilitation, has called for a political solution to the Tamil insurgency. The organization also says that many European states, including Russia, and those in the EU, have condemned the recent bombing in Colombo. There has been some controversy in Sri Lanka about the impartiality of NGOs (Reuters, 08/11/95).

Aug 12, 1995 The LTTE has officially rejected President Kumaratunga's devolution proposal. The plan has been accepted by all the parliamentary parties except the main opposition, the United National Party, which has yet to announce its position (Reuters, 08/12/95).

Aug 14, 1995 Some 4000 Tamils demonstrated in front of the UN Subcommission on Human Rights offices in Geneva, Switzerland, to show their support for the LTTE (Reuters, 08/14/95).

Aug 17, 1995 Sri Lanka has rejected third party mediation or talks with the LTTE to reach a peaceful solution to the Tamil insurgency (Reuters, 08/17/95).

Aug 20, 1995 Authorities report that the financial center of the LTTE has been destroyed. Eight people, including the funds manager of the Tigers, have been arrested by police. Over $40,000 was also recovered. The Tigers are one of the world's best equipped groups. They have a makeshift navy, an air wing, mobile radar, anti-aircraft missiles, and a supply of members willing to engage in suicide missions. Many of the funds provided to the LTTE are obtained from local Tamil businesspeople along with ethnic kin living abroad (Reuters, 08/20/95, 08/23/95).

Aug 25, 1995 Sri Lanka has reportedly purchased three gunboats, two landing aircraft, armored personnel carriers, and ammunition from China (Reuters, 08/25/95, 09/21/95).

Aug 26, 1995 Sources indicate that up to 50 Tigers were killed during their assault on a police post just south of Batticaloa. Eight soldiers also died (Reuters, 08/26/95).

Sep 1995 The LTTE is still holding 150 hostages, a week after it hijacked a ferry. The International Committee of the Red Cross is attempted to mediate. The escalation in violence in recent weeks is viewed as a precursor to a major army offensive (Reuters, 09/04/95).

Sep 14, 1995 The government has banned all private domestic flights following reports that the LTTE was planning an airborne attack on the Parliament (Reuters, 09/14/95).

Sep 21, 1995 For the first time since 1988, Sri Lanka has imposed censorship on military news, in response to what it calls "irresponsible" reporting. Some analysts believe the move follows reports of serious divisions in Kumaratunga's cabinet (Reuters, 09/21/95).

Sep 24, 1995 Around 3000 Buddhist monks demonstrated in the town of Kandy urging the President to withdraw her devolution proposal. The monks and many other Sinhalese fear the plan could be a stepping stone to an independent Tamil homeland. Since April, the government has spent $78 million to counteract the Tigers (Reuters, 09/24/95).

Sep 24, 1995 At least 20 children were reportedly killed following heavy shelling and aerial attacks in northern Jaffna region. Authorities denied the civilian claims. Meanwhile, 21 troops were killed when the LTTE sunk their naval boats (Reuters, 09/24/95).

Oct 1995 The leaders of four Tamil parties in Parliament have expressed serious concern following the recent deaths of 70 people as a result of airforce bombings against the LTTE in the northern Jaffna area. While stopping short of withdrawing their support from President Kumaratunga's minority government, they asked her to take steps to prevent future civilian casualties (Reuters, 10/01/95).

Oct 15, 1995 Sri Lanka is amassing tens of thousands of troops, backed by tanks and artillery, in the northern Jaffna region. The army's latest offensive, Operation Thunder Strike, is being hailed as a decisive effort to end the 12-year Tamil insurgency. Military sources claim that over 300 rebels have been killed since the operation began on October 1 (Reuters, 10/15/95).

Oct 20, 1995 Thousands of people in Colombo have fled their homes as two oil depots continue to blaze following an LTTE bombing attack. More than 20 people were killed (Reuters, 10/20/95).

Oct 22, 1995 Tamil Tigers have reportedly hacked 66 people to death in three villages in eastern Sri Lanka. The government states that it will reactivate civil defense forces in order to counter the LTTE threat. Volunteer forces were last deployed in 1971 to help promote order during the JVP insurgency (Reuters, 10/22/95).

Oct 22, 1995 Military sources state that Operation Riviresa (Sunshine), the campaign to take over Jaffna, has resulted in 350 rebel and 76 army casualties since its launch a week ago (Reuters, 10/22/95).

The proposal was unofficially released in August 1995 and it garnered the support of moderate Tamil political parties. The major change in today's proposal is that the president would be able to dissolve regional councils if they promote rebellion or violate the constitution.
