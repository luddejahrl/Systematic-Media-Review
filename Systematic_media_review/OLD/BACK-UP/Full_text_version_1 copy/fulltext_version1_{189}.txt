A rampage killer has been defined as follows:

A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons at least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.[1]

Rampage killings with 6 or more dead

Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and at least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)

Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and at least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)

An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.

In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

Also, those cases where a rampage killer used an armed vehicle, such as a tank, or a fighter aircraft, to shoot others are listed here. Airliners and trains are not included in this section but in other incidents.

As it is sometimes difficult to distinguish cases of grenade attacks from acts of terrorism or gang-related attacks, incidents are only included where there is at least some indication that it was neither committed in the context of a political, ethnic, or religious conflict, nor part of an assault with more than one participating offender.
