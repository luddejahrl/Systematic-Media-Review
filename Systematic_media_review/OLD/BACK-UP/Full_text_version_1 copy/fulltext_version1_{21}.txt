Shah Rukh Khan, Nayanthara and Atlee

Jaipur jamboree next

Shah Rukh Khan recently wrapped up the month-long shoot of Atlee’s Jawan with Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi. The Bollywood Badshah and the Lady Superstar, as the lead actors are known, will soon head to Jaipur for the final schedule of the big-ticket entertainer. While prep is underway, we hear that tight security arrangements will be in place to keep the crowd at bay during filming. Apparently, there might be a change in the schedule by a couple of days as Nayanthara and director-husband Vignesh Shivan became parents to twin boys over the weekend. Many important scenes and a song will be picturised during the three-week shoot, at the end of which it will be a wrap on the June 2023 release. After completing Jawan, SRK is slated to resume the shoot of Rajkumar Hirani’s Dunki later this year.

Sona slams Salman

Sona Mohapatra minced no words in criticising Salman Khan for continuing to have #MeToo accused Sajid Khan as a contestant in Bigg Boss 16. The songstress also talked about Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief, Swati Maliwal getting rape threats on social media for demanding Sajid’s ouster from the show. Sona tweeted, “Normalising toxic masculinity and such #heroes in #popculture will encourage more such dangerous behaviour #India.Welcome to more violence and sexual harassment. #SajidKhan #SalmanKhan bhai-hood (sic).”

Foraying into KGF space

Chiyaan Vikram will foray into Kannada actor Yash’s zone with his next. The Ponniyin Selvan: I (PS: I) actor recently underwent a look test for the action drama, tentatively titled Chiyaan61. To be helmed by Pa Ranjith, the period film is reportedly based on a real story of a marginalised community of miners who worked in Kolar Gold Fields during the British Raj. Rashmika Mandanna is being considered to play his leading lady in the film that will also release in 3D.

Empowering women

On the occasion of Karwa Chauth, Sonu Sood pledged to open several skill-development centres for women across India. He said, “The idea is to provide the necessary tools to women to empower themselves. For a country to progress, it is important for the women to be capable of financial independence.” Sonu added, “Often, we see families where women are the sole breadwinners. I want to provide them with necessary skill sets to get better jobs and improve their conditions.”

Tamannaah in Pushpa 2?

Even though Samantha set pulses racing with her moves in Oo antava song n Pushpa: The Rise (2021), she won’t feature in director Sukumar’s sequel. We hear Tamannaah Bhatia is being roped in for a special role in Pushpa: The Rule. Talk is that apart from a sizzling number in the Allu Arjun and Rashmika Mandanna-starrer, Tamannaah will play a substantial role in the narrative. Apparently, the Babli Bouncer actor plays the second love interest of Arjun’s Pushpa, the first being Rashmika’s Srivalli.

Inspired by Kishore da

During the recent promotions for Doctor G, Ayushmann Khurrana shared that for his next, Dream Girl 2, he has borrowed inspiration from the late Kishore Kumar. Calling the legendary actor-singer his “guru”, he said, “His work inspires me to push boundaries and explore uncharted territories.” Ayushmann, who plays a female impersonator in the comic franchsie, revealed that he has been listening to Kishore Da’s Aake seedhi lagi dil pe, on loop since he began shooting for Dream Girl 2. “His voice is magical and he has effortlessly rendered both male and female voices for this song.”

All is well

For a while now, rumours have been rife about trouble in Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s paradise. On Meghan Markle’s podcast, The Decoding of Crazy, the Gehraiyaan actor indirectly addressed the reports of marital discord. She said, “My husband was at a music festival for a week and he has just come back. So he’s going to be happy to see my face.” An advocate of mental health after battling depression, DP praised her family’s support during the critical juncture. She said, “Today it’s all about the little things, like hugging my sister or just late-night conversations with my husband — those are the moments that really fill me up today.”

Feeling lovesick already

Till the day before, Arjun Kapoor was pleased to have the company of ladylove Malaika Arora, who had flown to London, where he is shooting his next film. However, within hours of her leaving the UK capital to return to Mumbai, the Mubarakan actor had begun missing Malla. Sharing a picture of her on social media, he wrote, “Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone…” remembering Bill Withers’s classic romantic song. While Rakul Preet Singh, Arjun’s co-actor in the yet-untitled rom-com, commented, “Awww,” girlfriend Malaika responded, saying, “Aww baby” with a heart emoji. Really now!
