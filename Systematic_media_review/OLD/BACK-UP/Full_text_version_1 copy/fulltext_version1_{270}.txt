HOW OUR CLEAVER IS MADE:-

All our CLEAVER

is real and not just an acid etch . CLEAVER is a mixture of 1095 HC and 15n20 NC . You heat them up together and then fold the bar over and over to get the desired layers ,ours are 256+ . Then you burn the blade in acid and it turns the nickel stain color and high carbon turns blackish gray . All Damascus is acid etched to show the layers .



TIPS &PRECAUTIONS:-

The knife blade should always be clean and be treated with oil or wax after every use . Never store the knife for a long time in leather sheath . Leather can absorb moisture and may result in rusting the knife.
