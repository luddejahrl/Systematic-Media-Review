Time to take stock of Ugandan-Congolese military operations

AFRICA

DRC: Massacres Continue in East

According to you, the UN is corrupted because it lies about the fact that the town of Bunagana and part of the territory of Rutshuru (DRC) are occupied by the Rwandan army and that the town of Bunagana not being on the border of Rwanda, the Rwandan soldiers did not pass through Uganda to take the Congolese army from behind but fell from the sky. It is easy to call the UN corrupt when one is not informed about the facts on the ground.As for the results of the pooling of Congolese and Ugandan forces to fight the ADF, surveys conducted by NGOs, independent journalists and above all the population itself show that it has been an abject failure. I suggest below a few for your information:AFRICAAs in the neighboring province of Ituri, North Kivu has been under a state of siege for the past year, an exceptional measure that has given full power to the military but has so far failed to end the violence.As in the neighboring province of Ituri, North Kivu has been under a state of siege for the past year, an exceptional measure that has given full power to the military but has so far failed to end the violence.The joint military operations of the Congolese and Ugandan armies in eastern DRC had raised expectations among the population, which has been the victim of massacres committed by armed groups.These joint military operations were intended to put an end to the crimes committed in particular by the ADF rebels, which, since October 2014, have cost the lives of thousands of people.But the two new massacres perpetrated last Saturday and Sunday (May 28 and 29) by the ADF, which cost the lives of more than 50 civilians, have shown the limits of this military strategy.Mixed resultsJean-Baptiste Kasekwa, the national MP for Goma, believes that the lack of sufficient numbers of Congolese soldiers in joint military operations with Uganda explains the lack of results.On Saturday, at least 27 people were killed in a new massacre attributed to the ADF in the village of Beu-Manyama, also in the Beni region, according to the Kivu Security Barometer (KST).On Saturday, at least 27 people were killed in a new massacre attributed to the ADF in the village of Beu-Manyama, also in the Beni region, according to the Kivu Security Barometer (KST).The KST therefore calls for a strengthening of the FARDC, which is fighting alongside its Ugandan colleagues in Beni territory in North Kivu and in Irumu in Ituri."I deplore in particular the insufficient number of troops and the lack of logistics in the areas where the mutualization is taking place."The elected official from Goma also urges the joint FARDC-UPDF forces to share the areas of intervention so that the responsibilities of each army are well established."Entrust the UPDF with specific axes so that we can establish the responsibility of each force if ever, in the axis assigned to it, we see that the massacres continue, contrary to the current cacophony where those responsible blame each other," advises Jean-Baptiste Kasekwa.For his part, the coordinator of the human rights organization Forum de paix, Juste Matete, believes that the result of these operations is rather a failure.He therefore pleads for a revision of the military strategies put in place at the beginning of these operations, while integrating the population in future operations, in order to obtain better information."We ask that both forces review previous strategies that have proven to be unsuccessful. The two forces can also put in place joint mechanisms for alerting the population to report any suspicious movement," said Just Matete.Joint operation a good startThe ADF group is indicted for massacring thousands of civilians in the DRC and for committing jihadist attacks in Uganda (Congolese army image/Archives).The ADF group is indicted for killing thousands of civilians in the DRC and committing jihadist attacks in Uganda (Congolese army image/Archives).However, some military operations have been successful during the six months of joint operations.The reopening and securing of the Mbau-Kamango axis, a road where ambushes were frequent, is to the credit of the operations conducted by the FARDC and the UPDF.Although the military cooperation is coming to an end, it could be extended soon, a security source in the region told us.An evaluation meeting between Congolese and Ugandan army officials will take place this week in Uganda, before a possible extension of joint operations.Civilians and Red Cross volunteers attend the burial of 62 displaced people who were massacred on the night of February 4-5Civilians and Red Cross volunteers attend the burial of 62 displaced people who were massacred on the night of February 4-5The latest massacres have once again outraged the people of Beni, who have been living in fear for nearly eight years.The images of the bodies of the victims being transported on bicycles and motorcycles have shocked the inhabitants of the region, who now believe that the Ugandan army must react or leave Congolese territory."When the Ugandan army entered our country, the population was very happy because they saw an expectation. But now that our brothers and sisters continue to be massacred, it discourages us and we no longer see the importance of this army in this country," testified a resident on DW."We are going to ask the president to provide us with weapons to fight the ADF ourselves because we see that the Congolese army and the Ugandan army are not able to stop the massacres," another resident tells DW.Another resident told DW that "We will be compelled to go to the streets to chase them away and to return home to Uganda."We don't see the importance of the Ugandan army in this country anymore" (Resident)Thousands murderedThe joint military operations between the Congolese and Ugandan armies, launched since November 30, 2021, are indeed struggling to eradicate the ADF in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.The latest killings in the territories of Beni, Irumu and Mambasa, where nearly one hundred people were massacred with machetes and firearms, have thus provoked the anger of the inhabitants, already tested by years of violence.Pressure on the ADFViolence and human rights violations lead to humanitarian crisis in the eastTo justify this upsurge in massacres in Beni territory, the spokesperson for the Congolese army in the northern part of North Kivu, Captain Anthony Mualushay, refers to the pressure that the ADF are under in Ituri. They are therefore seeking refuge in North Kivu."The enemy is being cornered by our friends who are in coalition with the UPDF in Ituri and is now tending to come to North Kivu," said Captain Mualushay on DW.However, the Congolese government is being criticized for failing to provide its army with the resources it needs to operate in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.As you can imagine, this is only a sample of the articles and reports that show the reality of the failure of the joint Ugandan-Congolese military operation.
