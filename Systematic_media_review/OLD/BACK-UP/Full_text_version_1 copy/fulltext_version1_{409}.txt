“We are victims of a usurpation of our label by ill-intentioned individuals who have made chasubles similar to ours, who are prowling around schools and collecting the contributions due from students and parents,” wrote Chares Nghoguo, the general manager of this Cameroonian company specialising in sending money.

“The arrests are continuing and the investigation is pending at the DRPJ Centre,” according to the DG of Express Union. The latter assures that “precautionary measures” have been taken internally to put an end to this scam. In this case: the sensitization of headmasters, students and parents, the “massive” sensitization of Express Union staff to be more vigilant in the face of the phenomenon, as well as the raid on other high schools in Yaounde “to possibly arrest potential forgers.

“If you have had to carry out operations and you do not have confirmation that the funds are in the coffers of Minesec, you file a request addressed to the Director General in an Express Union branch. A correspondence will be sent to you,” sources within the company reports to media, simply outlining the procedure to follow. Since 17 August, parents, guardians and students have been invited to pay the required contributions electronically to the operator of their choice.
