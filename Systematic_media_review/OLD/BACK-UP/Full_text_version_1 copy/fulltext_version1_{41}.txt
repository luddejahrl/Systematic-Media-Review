STRESSVEST WAIVER User Warnings, Risks, Liability Release and Covenant Not to Sue (Includes OnPoint Solutions) PRIOR to any STRESSVEST® Training and PRIOR to any STRESSVEST® exposure, all persons MUST: (1) read the most current STRESSVEST® warnings; and (2) read and sign this form

IMPORTANT STRESSVEST® PRODUCT SAFETY AND HEALTH INFORMATION Read, understand, and follow current STRESSVEST® training, safety instructions, and warnings before experiencing a STRESSVEST® exposure and before participating in STRESSVEST® training. Any use of force or physical exertion involves risks that may cause injury or death. SAFETY INFORMATION: STRESSVEST® EXPOSURES STRESSVEST® utilizes a localized electrical discharge device that is designed to be placed on the abdomen, just below the navel. No Minors. Because of parental/guardian consent issues, no minor will be exposed to a STRESSVEST® electrical discharge as part of a training course, demonstration, or otherwise. Pregnant, Possibly Pregnant or Nursing females will NOT be allowed to participate in STRESSVEST® training. SAFETY INFORMATION: STRESSVEST® ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE DEVISES, KNOWN AND POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS Physiologic or Metabolic Effects. The electrical discharge can produce physiologic or metabolic effects which include, but are not limited to, changes in: acidosis, adrenergic states, blood chemistry, blood pressure, calcium, creatine kinase (“CK”), electrolytes (including potassium), lactic acid, myoglobin, histamine, pH, respiration, heart rate, rhythm, capture, stress hormones or other biochemical neuromodulators (e.g. catecholamines). Therefore, reasonable efforts should be made to minimize the number of electrical discharge exposures and resulting physiologic and metabolic effects. In human studies of electrical discharge from a single electrical discharge of up to 15 seconds, the effects on acidosis, CK, electrolytes, stress hormones, and vital signs have been comparable to or less than changes expected from physical exertion similar to struggling, resistance, fighting, fleeing, or from the application of some other force tools or techniques. Adverse physiologic or metabolic effects may increase risk of death or serious injury. The STRESSVEST® electrical discharge allows for a maximum 0.15 second exposure each activation, followed by a 100 millisecond rest period before any subsequent exposure. Muscle Contraction or Strain-Related Injury. Electric discharges can cause strong or moderate muscle contractions that may result in physical muscle, tendon, ligament, nerve, bone, joint injury or damage, exertion, athletic, or sport-type injury, including, but not limited to, injuries such as: hernia rupture, dislocation, tear, or other injury to soft tissue, organ, associated with or to orthopedic or other hardware. Fracture to bone, including compression fracture to vertebrae, may occur. These injuries may be more serious and more likely to occur in people with pre- existing injuries, orthopedic hardware, conditions or special susceptibilities, which include but are not limited to, known or unknown: pregnancy, osteopenia, osteoporosis, spinal injury, or previous muscle, disc, ligament, joint, bone, or tendon damage or surgery. Such injuries may also occur when a person reacts to the electrical discharge by making a rapid movement. Seizure. Repetitive stimuli (e.g. flashing light or electrical stimuli) can induce seizure in some people. This risk may be increased in a person with a seizure history or if electrical stimuli pass through the head area. This may also result in a person falling with a possible secondary injury. Stress and Pain. The STRESSVEST® electric discharge can cause temporary discomfort and pain which may result in stress, panic, anger, rage, or startle which may be injurious to some people and may cause adverse changes in blood chemistry. Additionally, anticipation of electric discharge exposure can cause stress, trepidation, panic, startle, or fear, which may also be injurious to some people. Neurocardiogenic Response (Fainting). A person may experience an exaggerated response to an electric discharge exposure, or threatened exposure, which may result in a person fainting or falling with possible secondary injury. SAFETY INFORMATION: STRESSVEST® USE Minimize Repeated, Continuous, or Simultaneous Exposures. Reasonable efforts should be made to minimize the number of electrical discharge exposures. STRESSVEST® instructors should use the lowest number of electric discharge exposures that are objectively reasonable to accomplish the training objective. LASER. The STRESSVEST® system uses a LASER to activate the STRESSVEST®. Any laser sold directly by SETCAN® Corporation has been rated a Class I eye safe laser by the US FDA and complies with US FDA CDRH 21CFR subchapter J parts 1040.10 and 1040.11. Although the laser is manufactured to be classified as eye safe, avoid intentionally aiming the LASER at the eye of a person as individual susceptibilities are unpredictable and injury may be possible. SETCAN® Corporation accepts no responsibility for any lasers that are not manufactured by SETCAN® Corporation. Incapacitation, Falling, and Startle Hazard. Electrical discharge use may cause muscular contraction, Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI), startling, and falling, which could result in death or serious injury. Stressvest should not be worn in a live state when operating motor vehicles, in an elevated environment, or any other environment where activation could lead to injury. Scarring. Use of an STRESSVEST® electric discharge may cause irritation, puncture, mark, abrasion, rash, burn, keloid, or other scarring that may be permanent. The nature and severity of these effects depends on numerous factors including the area of exposure, number of exposures, individual susceptibility, and other circumstances surrounding STRESSVEST® electric discharge use, exposure, and after care. An exaggerated histamine reaction may cause urticarial (hives/raised skin). Please fill out the sections below. If you have a condition or pre-existing injury that would be aggravated by muscle contractions, physical exertion, or stress check the appropriate box and notify the Instructor prior to participating in the STRESSVEST® electric discharge exposure or training course. Anyone with a serious medical issue or any other concerns that may place them at risk are prohibited from training with the STRESSVEST® system. LIABILITY RELEASE, COVENANT NOT TO SUE AND HOLD HARMLESS In consideration of the use of STRESSVEST® copyrighted training material and further understand that by signing this form I am giving up certain legal rights including the right to recover damages in case of injury; and I agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this form.

For those who will experience a STRESSVEST® electric discharge exposure: I understand that a STRESSVEST® electric discharge exposure results in strong muscle contractions, physical exertion, and stress and involves the risk of physical or other injury. I acknowledge that I have read the above Warnings and Risks and current STRESSVEST® warnings and with full knowledge of such risks, I voluntarily agree to experience a STRESSVEST® electric discharge exposure and I assume all risks, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, inherent in the STRESSVEST® electric discharge exposure.

This release does not release any rights I may have under Workers’ Compensation Laws. I waive any Workers’ Compensation subrogation rights against Setcan Corporation and the StressVest manufacturer. I agree that any recoveries under Workers’ Compensation Laws do not change, extend or enlarge the waivers and protections inherent in this agreement. I would like to state that I have the following pre-existing physical or mental condition(s) or injuries: I understand that my condition or injury could be aggravated by muscle contractions, physical exertion, stress, or exposure to the electrical discharge of STRESSVEST® system and it is my responsibility to check with a physician prior to participating in any STRESSVEST® training. I further understand if I choose to participate in training I must bring the injury to the attention of the instructor(s) and it is my responsibility to remove myself from any participation that could aggravate the injury. By signing below I am acknowledging I have read and understand the User Warnings, Risks, and freely and voluntarily agree to participate in the training course and FREELY and VOLUNTARILY AGREE to being exposed to the electrical discharge of the STRESSVEST® system. Do not sign if you do not agree or do not wish to participate in Stressvest related training. Please bring this to the attention of your instructor.
