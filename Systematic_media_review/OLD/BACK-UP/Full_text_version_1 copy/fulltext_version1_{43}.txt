The Royal Blues' home record has been poor over their last two spells in the Bundesliga, as they have won just three of their previous 18 league games in the German top flight. Hoffenheim have been poor travellers of late, having won just one of their previous eight away games in the Bundesliga.

Last time out in Ligue One, Lille recorded a 1-0 home win over Lens. The game ended a high-scoring run of games for LOSC in the Ligue One, as their previous seven Ligue One matches had all produced over 2.5 goals.
