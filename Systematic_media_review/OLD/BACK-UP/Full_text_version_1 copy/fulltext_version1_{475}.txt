This calls for research, Opobo wasn't a virgin land so who and who was there, if the people who were there, were actually Ijaws why should they throw away their language, it could mean that the natives there were Igbos, King Jaja arrived with 14 war houses, if we go by one canoe carrying 50 people, 50 × 14 isn't such a large number that would make them throw away their language, Igbo is also spoken in Bonny so Bonny is where we should start with,



For Opobo it was always been an independent state overseen by King Jaja and his dynasty that doesn't call for much argument for now lets start with why is Igbo wildly spoken in Bonny, Opobo is a different issue entirely, as for the lands whoever the people goes with the land belongs to the people now if we have to go in details we go in details, why is Igbo the major language spoken in Bonny and does it make absolutely no sense to term such place where Igbo is spoken as Igboland ?

The simple truth is that Igbos will not be relinquishing our ties with both Ubani (Bonny) and Opobo.

Both towns are still being traditionally led by Igbo royal families right from time immemorial. If we maintain such hard posture it will likely result in a war, which the people of Opobo and Bonny will suffer the most, we can agree on a system where one becomes officially part of AlaIgbo while the other becomes part of Ijaw, we can build bridge across, it doesn't mean we are relinquishing our people it is just that these people are mixed and to avoid major issues that can cause severe bad blood.



We would still interact with Bonny afterwards and we would be able to assist them if need be but to reduce such cost, truth is Nigeria may not even be outrightly dividing but we can build AlaIgbo within Nigeria, in the event that Nigeria divides it would be all for himself but peaceful approach would help us focus on other challenges as a Nation let's go for peace, if it fails at least we know we tried it is not easy but thats the best If we maintain such hard posture it will likely result in a war, which the people of Opobo and Bonny will suffer the most, we can agree on a system where one becomes officially part of AlaIgbo while the other becomes part of Ijaw, we can build bridge across, it doesn't mean we are relinquishing our people it is just that these people are mixed and to avoid major issues that can cause severe bad blood.We would still interact with Bonny afterwards and we would be able to assist them if need be but to reduce such cost, truth is Nigeria may not even be outrightly dividing but we can build AlaIgbo within Nigeria, in the event that Nigeria divides it would be all for himself but peaceful approach would help us focus on other challenges as a Nation let's go for peace, if it fails at least we know we tried it is not easy but thats the best 2 Likes

Nwokem, you can bleat all you want, Bonny and Opobo will remain Igbo terrtories till thy kingdom come. Some Igbo territories still use OBA as the title of their traditional rulers and they still relate with their fellow wider Igbo communities.



Igbo remains the number one traditional language being spoken in both Bonny and Opobo.



The first attachment clearlys shows that

1. The lineage of the traditional rulers of Bonny, is Igbo

2. The middle class and indigenes of Bonny are of Igbo descent.

3. The slaves were also chiefly Igbo. But of course, we know that Ijaw cannibals, Ibibio and Edo slaves will also be there



So basically the first attachment clearly insinuates that the slave traders in Bonny were Igbos. That will make sense, because Aro middlemen are much more likely to deal with their fellow Igbo Bonny slave merchants that spoke their language.



The second attachment clearly shows the true map of Igboland and drawn by Basden, decades before Nigeria was created. I know Ijaws have great respect for Basden and his opinions regarding the Niger Delta. Please further have respect for the map of Igboland that he drew

The bolded is 100% unacceptable.



Igbos will not be rewarding any landgrabbing back-stabbing moves. It is more justifiable to reward people who didn't try to expropriate our ancestral territories than those who did that.



For Igbos to give up Bonny, Ijaws will have to provide an admirable piece of territory in exchange. But it is unlikely the royal household of Bonny will ever agree to severing their links with their Igbo blood relatives, neither will they be willing to have their land, considered a complete Ijaw territory.

So the best option is for Ijaws to remain in their territory and let Igbos of Bonny and Opobo be. Of course, Igbos realise that there are non-Igbo people in those areas, so they will have to be well accommodated, so that they don't feel like aliens overnight.

You obviously are not aware of what happened earlier on this year in Bonny.

These Ijoids tried to install an AMADABO in a chunk of Bonny territory, an action that was clearly perceived by the real Bonny indigenes, including the royal family of Bonny, as an attempt to whittle down the Amayanabo's power as they see him as an Igbo man.

Of course, the Amayanabo and his people dealt seriously with the situation, and real Bonny indigenes followed it up by releasing a press statement, making it clear that they have Igbo ancestry, while also conceding the fact that some Ijoids also settled around the Finima area of Bonny.

You have spoken well however I wish you also sees the dangers, I really appreciate your birds, from what you said, it means Bonny would be a protectorate or at best independent, I have also hinted on the inability for either Bonny or Opobo to protect herself in the event of independence they would constantly be attacked by the Ijaws.



You understand completely that the Igbos from my perspective is satisfied with what God have given us as such we would not want any other Ijaw territories in exchange for any of our affiliated people unless they want to sell any of their territories afterall United States bought Alaska.



Opobo closer to us so we can easily protect Opobo with our navy through the Imo Rivers and the Atlantic but Bonny is surround at all angle by the sea, it will make them susceptible to Ijaw pirates, we can easily station in Opobo in terms of war however Bonny is going to be a battle ground, is that what we want? We can agree to go with Opobo and watch how far they can manage going with Bonny, if along the line Bonny rejects them we can then assist them.

Bonny and Opobo cannot be separated no matter what. Neither can they go to either Igbo or Ijaw. Rather they will be an independent Island nation under the joint protectorate of Biafran and Ijaw republic forces. 2 Likes

That's the issue and I'm happy now you made a contribution and the case now is that at one point and a man with Igbo blood was an Amanyabo of Opobo, when England and Scotland got to that blood confusion, what happened, UK was birthed, so what is your proposal for an Igbo Amanyabo whose decendants of mixed ancestry still rules Opobo? There is no mix blood of Igbo anywhere.

This is another good point, however Opobo and Bonny being a joint protectorate of two enemies could end like International space station where Russia has threatened to pull out,



The most important thing is peace, no one really intend to separate them but being protectorate between Igbos and Ijaws is dangerous becuase if we disagree the two communities would be battle ground, let both be independent protectorate, Opobo becomes Igbo protected while Bonny becomes Ijaw protected, in this case Igbo can see Opobo as part of AlaIgbo while Nigeria exist while Ijaws can see Bonny as part of Izon while Nigeria exist, fact is if Nigeria divide the question is what caused the division?

Yorubas can't claim Edo as Edo is older than Yoruba. Yoruba is not a single state what you could compare to Edo is Oyo, Ife, these are the people that came together to form the modern Yoruba as we know, what you could have said is Edo claiming Yorubas becuase Edo is older than Yoruba



If King Jaja was alive to rule any further, all these wouldn't have been an issue becuase if you red his history you would realise that Opobo was only closer to his root, how can you compare Edo a people whose civilisation is older and more refined than any Yoruba civilisation, this arrogance and disrespect is why Benin can't work with Yorubas because you steal their history.



Opobo on the other hand was fouinded by a man with Igbo blood

Wrong again..

I don't know if anyone noticed the way the OP was mentioning WAR in almost all his replies. Even some keyboard warriors are rolling drums of war. The amazing thing is that the elders of Alaigbo and the main stakeholders have not said anything. I believe they are wise enough to know how to handle conflicts like this.



I think this generation of Igbo youths are always spoiling for war and since no one has their time the war is now going on in their own domain - Alaigbo vs Alaigbo; in the form of ESN vs Autopilots vs IPOB vs MASSOB vs UGM vs Kidnappers vs ogwu ego ritualists vs elites.

Yorubas can't claim Edo as Edo is older than Yoruba. Yoruba is not a single state what you could compare to Edo is Oyo, Ife, these are the people that came together to form the modern Yoruba as we know, what you could have said is Edo claiming Yorubas becuase Edo is older than Yoruba



If King Jaja was alive to rule any further, all these wouldn't have been an issue becuase if you red his history you would realise that Opobo was only closer to his root, how can you compare Edo a people whose civilisation is older and more refined than any Yoruba civilisation, this arrogance and disrespect is why Benin can't work with Yorubas because you steal their history.



Opobo on the other hand was founded by a man with Igbo blood

What you said about king Jaja here would have been valid if he actually conquered and captured Opobo. But he was a slave who was brought to prominence by his master. This singular point is what you guys fail to understand.



Ibani had already been in existence before King Jaja's emergence. He didn't try to take the land even as a king and he preferred to naturalize there instead.



But how, generations later, some people are now trying to twist history and collect what King Jaja never professed to be his, nor even colonized, is amazing to me.

Please I'm trying to make a sensible proposal that could help us navigate through future calamity, I clearly stated it is about Igbo and Ijaws and have nothing to do with the rest of Nigeria, any true Ijaw son and daughter knows the truth to these situations and so is every true Igbo so it is a sensitive situation nearly as that of Ilorin between Yorubas and Fulani atache by force atache by force 2 Likes

Imagine such shamble reasoning..

Ur words is full of guesses and insinuations that are baseless.

The people their igbos?

How if anyone may ask?

Has Igbo of hinterlands any connections with the Atlantic?

They fear ordinary river so much that they can't even live close enough by it...

So andoni ijaw people are now igbos?



U v not made ur research yet u r here claiming what is not even part of history, manufacturing fictions from ur head and want to sell them because u want to grab lands.

Here u threaten war.



Let me ask u?



If Niger delta is created, who will give ur army the right of way towards Opobo or Bonny?

Does any single Igbo community v a boundary with ibani people of Opobo or Bonny?

The answer is NO!!

So what is ur problem?



They are planning to takeover Ogoniland by force in order to reach Bonny and Opobo



That is why IPOB are already renaming Oyigbo Obigbo



Oyigbo was built on Ogoni land that the Ogoni gave to some Igbos who were friendly with them They are planning to takeover Ogoniland by force in order to reach Bonny and OpoboThat is why IPOB are already renaming Oyigbo ObigboOyigbo was built on Ogoni land that the Ogoni gave to some Igbos who were friendly with them 1 Like

King Jaja ruled Opobo for 18 years, and today his linage still rules Opobo, not just Opobo but also Bonny is contested, you bring the concept of conquest into it, then I ask was King Jaja not defeated in Bonny before he left and founded Opobo, we are all giving sense of reasoning and arguments because peace is the best option and if peace fail, it would still be decided but with so much cost in human lives, King Jaja ruled Opobo for 18 years, and today his linage still rules Opobo, not just Opobo but also Bonny is contested, you bring the concept of conquest into it, then I ask was King Jaja not defeated in Bonny before he left and founded Opobo, we are all giving sense of reasoning and arguments because peace is the best option and if peace fail, it would still be decided but with so much cost in human lives,

So what is ur problem? Who is creating Niger Delta lol, that’s a joke taken too far you know, your mates who have clearly seen the handwriting on the wall is Talking about Ijaw Republic yet you are here talking about Niger Delta Republic that is Dead.



Forget your Niger Delta Republic let’s talk on something that has possibility of happening, such Niger Delta Republic can’t hold water, talk about your Ijaw Republic and stop attaching to others, as you can see millennials and Gen Z Igbos are more about AlaIgbo Republic Who is creating Niger Delta lol, that’s a joke taken too far you know, your mates who have clearly seen the handwriting on the wall is Talking about Ijaw Republic yet you are here talking about Niger Delta Republic that is Dead.Forget your Niger Delta Republic let’s talk on something that has possibility of happening, such Niger Delta Republic can’t hold water, talk about your Ijaw Republic and stop attaching to others, as you can see millennials and Gen Z Igbos are more about AlaIgbo Republic
