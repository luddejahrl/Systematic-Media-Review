Whether you live in the affluent Kensington and Chelsea or the working-class streets of Southall you can't turn on the news without hearing about another teenager being killed on our streets.As of November 2017, a total of 35 young people under the age of 25 have been murdered in the capital in the last 12 months, an 84 percent rise on the same period last year.The number of cases involving young Somali men is a staggering 22.8% of the 35 murders across the capital, with 3 of those murder taking place in the London Borough of Ealing.The purpose of this meeting is twofold, firstly to send a clear message that â€“ those who carry knives or seek to do harm are not welcome in our community and secondly for members of the Somali community to voice their concerns with the Met Police and their elected officials.
