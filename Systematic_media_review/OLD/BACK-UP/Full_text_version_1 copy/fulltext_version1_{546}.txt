Russian reprisals for Crimean bridge attack

A fireball consumed two sections of the only bridge linking the occupied Crimean Peninsula to Russia on Saturday, disrupting the most important supply line for Russian troops fighting in southern Ukraine. The attack dealt an embarrassing — if mostly symbolic — blow to the Kremlin, which is facing continued losses on the battlefield and mounting criticism at home.

Yesterday, as some prominent Russians called for fierce reprisals, the Kremlin launched a barrage of rockets at Ukrainian civilian areas, sending a deadly reminder that for all its battlefield losses, Moscow can still inflict mass misery. Missiles slammed into civilian areas of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least 20 people.

Though Russian officials made a show of reopening the bridge to some automobile and train traffic, the extent of the damage, as well as the timeline for Moscow to resume the transport of much-needed military equipment and ammunition, remains unclear. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, decried the explosion as a terrorist attack. Details about how it was carried out remain spotty.

Responsibility: The government in Kyiv has not yet officially claimed the attack. However, Ukrainian officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the country’s intelligence services were behind the bombing and that explosives had been loaded onto a truck that was driven onto the bridge and detonated.
