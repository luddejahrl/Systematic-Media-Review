Russia strikes key city after bridge attack

Russia fired 20 missiles at residential areas of Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, killing at least 13 people and injuring 60, Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

The strikes came after an explosion on Saturday destroyed part of the Kerch Strait Bridge, the only bridge that connects the Russian mainland to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. A senior Ukrainian official said the blast was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services.

The 12-mile bridge is the most important supply line for Russian troops fighting in southern Ukraine, and destroying part of it was a personal affront to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, who presided over its opening in 2018 and described the explosion as a “terrorist attack” on Sunday.

What’s next: Russian news reports said that some road and rail traffic had resumed, but trucks were backed up on either side of the bridge. After the attack, celebrations in Kyiv gave way to apprehension over possible Russian reprisals.
