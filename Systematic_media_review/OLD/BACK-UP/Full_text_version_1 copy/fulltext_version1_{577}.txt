Prince William and Kate Middleton are set to focus more on one key issue, as the "power couple" prepares to one day reign. When his father, the now King, was Prince of Wales, he was often criticised for speaking out too much on issues that mattered to him - such as climate change. However, the new Prince and Princess of Wales have been tipped to step up a gear with their campaigning, without straying into the political.

Lord William Hague, who's worked with the prince for eight years and is now the chair of William and Kate's charity told Sky News: "Certainly in the royal foundation, we're not changing tone, you know, if anything, we're going up another gear with a tone that's well established of how to help with certain issues of some of society's deepest problems where we need to bring people together to work on."

Sky News royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills added: "I'm told doing more to help the homeless is one area where we could see more work, especially now [William] has the network of land and businesses associated with the Duchy of Cornwall to play with as heir."
