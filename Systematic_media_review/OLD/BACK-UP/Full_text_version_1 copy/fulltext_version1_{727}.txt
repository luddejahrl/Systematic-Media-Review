Putin accuses Ukraine of terrorism over Crimea bridge blast

Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of terrorism, saying they attacked the bridge to Russian-annexed Crimea.

The Russian president said Ukraine’s intelligence forces had aimed to destroy an important piece of Russia’s civil infrastructure.

Russian officials say three people were killed in the bridge blast. They say the victims were in a nearby car when a lorry exploded.

“There is no doubt, this is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying Russia’s critical civilian infrastructure,” Mr Putin said.

“Its authors, perpetrators and beneficiaries are the security services of Ukraine.”

An investigation into the incident has been ordered by Russian officials.

Ukraine has not indicated that its forces were behind the attack, but the Ukrainian president’s adviser denied Putin’s accusations.

He wrote that there is “only one terrorist state here” and that the “whole world knows who it is”.

“Does Putin accuse Ukraine of terrorism? It looks too cynical even for Russia,” he said.
