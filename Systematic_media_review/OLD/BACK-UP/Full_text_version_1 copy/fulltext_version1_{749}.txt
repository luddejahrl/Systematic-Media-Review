Activity Summary: The summit eruption of Kīlauea Volcano, within Halemaʻumaʻu crater, continued over the past 24 hours. All recent eruptive activity has been confined to the crater. No significant changes have been observed at the summit or in either rift zone.

Halemaʻumaʻu Lava Lake Observations: Eruption of lava from the western vent into the active lava lake and onto the crater floor continued over the past 24 hours. The active part of the lava lake has been steady over the past 24 hours. Overflight measurements from October 5, 2022, indicated that the crater floor had seen a total rise of about 143 meters (469 feet), and that 111 million cubic meters (29.2 billion gallons) of lava had been effused since the beginning of this eruption on September 29, 2021.

Summit Observations: Summit tiltmeters recorded continued slight inflationary deformation over the last 24 hours. Volcanic tremor remains above background levels. A sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission rate of approximately 1,800 tonnes per day (t/d) was measured on September 30, 2022.
