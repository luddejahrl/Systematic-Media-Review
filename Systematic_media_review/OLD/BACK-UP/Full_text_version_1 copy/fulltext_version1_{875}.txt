States marked 'TC' are widely considered technologically capable of wielding, operating or developing nuclear weapons, however are signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and are not known to possess any at the current moment. Japan, South Korea and Poland[citation needed] are generally considered de facto nuclear states due to their believed ability to wield nuclear weapons within 1 to 3 years.[176][177][178] South Africa produced six nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but dismantled them in the early 1990s. South Africa signed the NPT in 1991.[179][180]
