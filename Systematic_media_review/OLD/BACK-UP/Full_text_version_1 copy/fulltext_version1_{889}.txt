This annual summit is the flagship event of our Peace, Security & Defence programme. Bringing together senior decision-makers with out-of-the-box movers and shakers, this summit allows for an in-depth and innovative discussion on todayâ€™s most pressing security and defence issues.

Composed of a series of interactive debates, this summit will address current geopolitical tensions, while focusing on the quest for European re-armament in the context of the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine, the role that emerging and disruptive technologies will play in the future of European defence, and possible security cooperation between Europe and Africa.

For each session, we will welcome up to 200 senior stakeholders, who will have the opportunity to engage directly with the speakers, MEPs and MPs, senior officials from international organisations, business and civil society representatives, European Young Leaders and journalists.

This event will take place in Brussels and will also be available to a wider audience via livestream. Follow us on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram or Facebook, and join the #SecuritySummit discussion!
