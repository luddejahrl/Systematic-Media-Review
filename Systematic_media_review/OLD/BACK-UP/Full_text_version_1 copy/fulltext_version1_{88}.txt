Amir reported the Messenger of Allah صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم as saying: The woman who buries alive her new-born girl and the girl who is buried alive both will go to Hell. This tradition has also been transmitted by Ibn Masud from the Prophet صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم to the same effect through a different chain of narrators.
