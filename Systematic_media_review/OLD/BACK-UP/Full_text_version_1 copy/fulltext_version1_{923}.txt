Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and Rep. Ilhan Omar were in Minneapolis Tuesday to celebrate the expansion of a clinic that for over 50 years has been offering low-cost health care to immigrants in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. The new improvements to the Cedar-Riverside Peopleâ€™s Center Clinic include a walk-in clinic, a fitness center, a prayer room, and a call center with staffers who are fluent in several languages including Oromo, Somali, Spanish, and Amharic.
