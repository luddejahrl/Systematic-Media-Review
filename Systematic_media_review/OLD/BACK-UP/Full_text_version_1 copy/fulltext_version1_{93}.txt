A 24 year old man was yesterday shot and killed in a foiled attack on the offices of the Uganda Revenue Authority in the West Nile district of Koboko.

The now deceased assistant has been identified as Vincent Ngota, a resident of Arese village in Midia Sub county, who reportedly escaped from the UPDF.

Police says Ngota took advantage of an Independence Day procession to attack on SPC Yosa Poru, one of the guards at the URA offices, and managed to grab and take away his gun.

“As the guard officers were busy concentrating on a big crowd that was matching along Koboko-Yumbe Road during the independence day celebrations, one Ngota Vincent attacked SPC Yosa Poru, hit him on the forehead with a claw metallic harmer, robbed his Riffle number UG. POL 564809077-10294 with 30 rounds of ammunitions amidst serious struggle,” said area police spokesperson Josephine Angucia.

“In the process, a UPDF officer RA Aduaze Ahumad joined the struggle to save his colleague and recover the said gun.”

But according to the police mouthpiece, Ngota overpowered them with the gun and ran towards Alimakodra cell, where notorious thugs commonly stay.

“RA Aduaze Ahumad shot a warning bullet on the ground so as to make him surrender the gun, but one Ngota instead turned back to him in an attempt to shoot at the officer. In self defense the officer shot him dead.”

Angucia adds that SPC Yosa Poru was severely injured in the attack and rushed to Koboko health centre IV for treatment, from where he was transferred to Arua Regional Referral Hospital.

Witnesses who spoke to police said the deceased had escaped from the UPDF and hid in Iganga and had now returned to claim his share of family property.

This is the second attack on the URA office in a few months.

In March this year, the same office was attacked and burnt by assailants in which one person was killed and 8 were injured.
