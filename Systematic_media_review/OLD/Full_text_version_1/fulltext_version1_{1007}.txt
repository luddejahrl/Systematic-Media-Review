The Yardbirds are far from being the most famous English rock band from mid-60s, yet they are definitely unique.

In the last Rolling Stone‘s 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, household names Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck ranked at 2, 3 and 5, respectively. In a span of 18 months, in 1965/1966, all 3 of them were part of the band’s line-up, although only the last two coincided.

When singer Keith Relf and drummer Jim McCarty left in 1968, Jimmy Page carried on initially as the New Yardbirds, before quickly changing his new groups name to, Led Zeppelin. The rest is history.

Today, we kick our Eric Clapton career review with the Yardbirds‘ CSPC, a band that launched big names but still had its own share of hits.
