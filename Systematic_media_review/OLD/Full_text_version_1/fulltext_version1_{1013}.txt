The Who have announced an exciting line-up of special guests to join them on THE WHO HITS BACK! Tour. The Who have raised the bar once again on their incredible legacy by inviting a wide range of special guest artists to join on the tour: Texas rockers Los Lonely Boys, the hard rocking band led by (guitarist/co-writer Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers) Mike Campbell and The Dirty Knobs, singer/songwriter Leslie Mendelson, British female-led rock band The Wild Things, Americana soul singer Amythyst Kiah, singer/songwriter and founder of Barenaked Ladies Steven Page, guitarist, singer/songwriter Dan Bern, and opening for one night at the Bethel Woods show, Willie Nile.

The Who’s upcoming North American trek promises to be another rock n’ roll knockout, bringing Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend back to US venues two years after their acclaimed MOVING ON! Tour, which wowed audiences with a series of sold-out dates. THE WHO HITS BACK! Tour (see complete list of dates below) will again share the stage with some of the finest orchestras in the US and Canada. Produced by Live Nation, the tour kicks off April 22 in Hollywood, FL at the Hard Rock Live for its spring leg, and returns in the fall on October 2 in Toronto, ON at Scotiabank Arena.

The Who are hitting most of the cities they were set to play in 2020 with multiple new stops, including shows in New Orleans, LA at the New Orleans Jazz Festival on April 30, and a much-anticipated performance at New York City’s Madison Square Garden on May 26. After a summer break, The Who will continue in the fall, including stops in Chicago, IL at United Center on October 12, and in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Bowl on November 1. The Who Hits Back! Tour winds down with two shows in Las Vegas, NV on November 4 + 5 at Dolby Live at Park MGM.

THE WHO HITS BACK! Tour will feature THE WHO’s full live band comprising guitarist/backup singer Simon Townshend, keyboardist Loren Gold, second keyboardist Emily Marshall, bassist Jon Button, drummer Zak Starkey and backing vocals by Billy Nicholls along with orchestra conductor Keith Levenson, lead violinist Katie Jacoby and lead cellist Audrey Snyder, passionately delivering THE WHO’s many classics, as well as songs from their most recent album, titled WHO.

Produced by Live Nation, The Who’s North American THE WHO HITS BACK! Tour will deliver their indelible brand of powerhouse rock through 28 cities.
