These living micro organisms are capable of increasing availability of plant nutrients to the crops due to their microbial activity in soil and plants. Fertilizer containing such micro organisms are called Bio-fertilisers. FACT is marketing bio fertiliser under the trade name BIOFACT . It can be applied by seed treatment or seedling dip or direct application to the field.The efficacy of the Bio-fertiliser can be substantially enhanced by applying it along with FACT ORGANIC .

Bio-fertilisers produced and marketed by FACT are:

a. BIOFACT-AZOSPIRILLUM

These biofertilisers are micro organisms, which are suitable for enhancing Nitrogen availability for all crops. They fix atmospheric Nitrogen in the soil to the tune of 20 to 25 kg per hectare over a period of two years. By sustained application of Azospirillum, Nitrogen application can be reduced to the tune of 20 to 25 percentage.

b. BIOFACT-RHIZOBIUM

These microorganisms are specifically suited to the requirements of leguminous crops.They live in symbiosis within root nodules of Pulse crops such as Green gram, Red gram etc., fix atmospheric Nitrogen and make it readily available to host plants.

c. BIOFACT-PHOSPHATE SOLUBILISING BACTERIA

These microorganisms are capable of converting unavailable form of Phosphorus in soil to available form of Phosphorus so that the plants can absorb the nutrient very easily.
