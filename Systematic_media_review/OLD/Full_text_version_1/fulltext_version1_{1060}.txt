After the successful 15th Edition in Jinja dubbed Nyam on the Nile, Roast And Rhyme is back to Kampala at Jahazi Pier Munyonyo for the 16th Edition on 30th October.

“This Halloween edition sets to elicit the fun and spooky side of revellers while they enjoy the various meats and afro music as we close October off by the lakeside,” the organizers said.

Throwing it back to 2016, a new event hit Uganda’s entertainment and social calendar and years later, Roast and Rhyme has given revellers a family day out experience by the lakeside and still draws massive crowds to its promise of roasted meat eaten to the entertaining sound of live music and performances.

If you have been to past editions of the outdoor event, you know fun is always a given. With the Halloween theme, you will have to get your outfit ideas and masks ready to standout at the event.

“Swangz Avenue never disappoints, and has lots of surprises expected to mash up the vibes on the day especially with the performances,” the organizers added.

The upcoming family day out event will see revellers getting to party hard with live music performances by Uganda’s best acts, deejay sets for the after party with lots of outdoor family and groupie activities and games.

Being a fully family event, the event will start as early as possible with gates being opened at 11 am.

The Afro Halloween edition of Roast and Rhyme will be a class apart with fresh vibes and Mpola Enjoyments as it’s the last edition of the biggest event this year.

Early bird tickets go for 80k or 100k at the venue on the day of the event.
