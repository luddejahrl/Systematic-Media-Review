MEXICO — An armed man was shot by police Thursday night.

Mexico and Rumford police responded to a report of a domestic violence disturbance at 10:46 p.m. at 87 Roxbury Road, according to a statement from Maine State Police. Officers confronted an armed male at the scene, according Mexico Police Chief Roy Hodsdon.

Mexico police officer Dustin Broughton fired his gun, according to the statement. Daniel Tibbetts, 22, of Mexico was transported to Rumford Hospital by Med Care Ambulance with gunshot wounds. He was later transported to Maine Medical Center in Portland for further treatment and was expected to survive, according to the statement.

A video shot from a nearby residence recorded three officers carrying flashlights and walking cautiously together on Roxbury Road. Officers were heard yelling “Put it down!” twice before three shots were fired. That was followed by an officer yelling, “Put it down. Don’t move.”

The shooting victim was not seen in the video.

Broughton has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the Attorney General’s Office — which is standard procedure in Maine for any officer involved shootings.
