Another day, another modeling gig.

Leni Olumi Klum — the daughter of supermodel Heidi Klum — is right back to work after she and her famous mom posed in what some called a “disturbing” Intimissimi lingerie campaign.

On Thursday, the 18-year-old beauty posted a picture and video to Instagram promoting Dior’s J’adore perfume.

“Flowers, water, that’s it,” the up-and-coming model captioned the still. “J’adore Parfum d’Eau, my new favorite fragrance by @diorbeauty.”

In the video ad, she gets gussied up in Dior makeup and clothes before heading to a promotional event for the new scent.

She joined the Dior family in April as a Germany Dior Makeup Ambassador.

The posts come days after Leni and her model mom, a former Victoria’s Secret Angel, stripped down to their skivvies for an Italian lingerie brand.

Neither woman has responded to the flack the ad has received.

Maybe that’s because Leni is more focused on furthering her education. Heidi recently told “Entertainment Tonight” that her eldest child will be attending college in New York.

“I am [so proud]. You know, she has her head screwed on right,” the “America’s Got Talent” judge said.

“Right now, college is on top of the list,” she added. “It’s not modeling and she’s really excited for that next chapter in her life.”

Leni not pursuing modeling full-time seems a bit surprising. She has already appeared in German Vogue with her mother and has had solo shots for Russian Elle, German Harper’s Bazaar and more.
