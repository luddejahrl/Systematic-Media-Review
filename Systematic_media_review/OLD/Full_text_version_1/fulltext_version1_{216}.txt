Lecturers in Nigeria’s universities have suspended which began eight months ago.

They were demanding better funding for universities, more facilities, and an improved pay system among other issues.

Several rounds of talks with the government had failed to resolve the dispute. Last month a court ordered the lecturers to end the strike but their union appealed against the decision.

However, in the early hours of Friday, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (Asuu) announced the suspension of the strike after a meeting of its leaders overnight.

Union vice-president Chris Piwuna confirmed the suspension of the strike to the BBC.

The conditions for the suspension are not immediately clear.

The union has now asked its members to resume work on Monday next week.

Earlier this week the union gave the clearest indication to end the strike after a meeting with key leaders of Nigeria’s parliament.

The eight-month industrial action was one of the longest strikes by university lecturers in Nigeria. It disrupted academic activities in the country’s public universities, affecting around two million students.

The suspension of the strike comes as a huge relief to the students after months of anxious waiting.
