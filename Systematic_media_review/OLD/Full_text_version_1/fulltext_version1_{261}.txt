A southern Indiana police officer fatally shot a machete-wielding man who charged at him inside a Walmart, authorities say.

The Walmart had closed to customers for the evening Monday night when employees around 11:15 p.m. notified three Clarksville Police Department officers outside the store that a suspicious man was walking around inside, Indiana State Police said.

The man, later identified as Daniel Francis Scott, 30, of Corydon, Indiana, disregarded requests to leave the store, state police said. Scott also appeared to have severe lacerations to the side of his neck.

The officers saw Scott walking around inside the store and he brandished a machete-style knife when approached and charged toward one officer, state police said. That officer fired his department handgun, striking Scott, who was pronounced dead at a hospital.
