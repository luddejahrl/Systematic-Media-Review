Some of the things to keep after owning the sword

---At least once each month or after each usage, lubricate the blade using a machine, gun , or other type of oil and make sure to avoid leaving any traces of fingerprints on the blade.



---If rust starts to form, clean the blade with some gasoline or oil first, then use fine sandpaper to remove it. Finally, wipe the blade clean and add oil. To re-shine the rusted area, use a buffing machine.



---To always keep your sword in good condition, use shoe polish on the leather sheath, furniture wax on the wood, Brasso (brass polish) on the brass fittings, and Silvo (silver polish) on the silver occasionally.



---When on display, be careful to regularly wipe the blade's surface of any dirt, insect feces, or other debris. Also, keep the blade away from water and other wet areas at all times.



---Avoid exposing the scabbard to the sun for an extended amount of time since the heat may cause it to slightly shrink, making it more difficult to draw in or pull out the blade.
