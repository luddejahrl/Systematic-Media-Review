Lewes Crown Court, where the14-year-old was sentenced

A 14-year-old boy has ben jailed following a stabbing in Worthing in March this year.

Police were on patrol in Liverpool Road, where a 13-year-old boy had sustained wounds to his legs and shoulder on March 13.

The boy received immediate first aid and was taken to hospital, where he was later discharged.

Chief Inspector Sarah Leadbeatter, district commander for Adur and Worthing, said: “This was a truly shocking incident which took place during daylight hours in the middle of a busy town centre.”

The 14-year-old, from Worthing, pleaded guilty to the charges of grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a knife in public.

He appeared before Lewes Crown Court on September 29 and was sentenced to four years in a youth offenders institute, plus two years on extended licence.

Chief Inspector Leadbeatter added: “I hope this significant sentence sends a strong message to those willing to carry and knife and use it to inflict harm on others, that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated and we will do everything within our power to hold these people to account and ensure they are dealt with robustly.”

A total of seven youths were arrested in connection with the stabbing, none of whom can be named for legal reasons.

Three youths were released with no further action and the remaining three were discounted by the Crown Prosecution Service and will also face no further action.
