Target: Richard Goldinger, District Attorney of Butler County, PA

Goal: Prohibit man accused of stabbing pet dog from further contact with animals.

A Pennsylvania man allegedly attacked his own dog with a kitchen knife. According to reports, Christopher Chuhra grabbed the knife after being bitten, then stabbed the animal at least three times. Thankfully, the husky benefitted from emergency surgery and is reportedly recovering.

Chuhra, on the other hand, faces aggravated animal cruelty charges. This case seemingly demonstrates how animals are often used as convenient targets for the anger of a human because they cannot fight back. Any individual caring for a pet should realize the responsibility that comes with being near an animal with natural instincts like biting.

Sign the petition below to urge that a ban on pet ownership and contact with animals be included among the pursued penalties in this case.

PETITION LETTER:

Dear DA Goldinger,

A dog nearly lost his life after his owner and caretaker allegedly stabbed him. If not for emergency surgical intervention, this innocent animal could have suffered an agonizing death. Christopher Chuhra stands accused of violating his duty of care and perpetuating aggravated animal cruelty.

Please pursue these charges with vigilance and do everything in your power to ensure Mr. Chuhra, if found guilty, is barred from contact with any more future potential victims.

Sincerely,

[Your Name Here]
