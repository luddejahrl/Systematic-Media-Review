Viruses exist everywhere from the air, earth, to animal bodies. These tiny organisms have diameters that measure in nanometers. Quite a good number of viruses live in human bodies. Most viruses are harmless to the body because the immune system produces antibodies that work against the viruses seeking to destroy them.

A harmful virus could be opportunistic. This means that when the human immune system gets weak due to certain reasons, the virus takes advantage of the situation to become a pathogen. Sometimes the virus and the immune system often lie in a balanced system. For example, in the kidney lies the BK polyomavirus. It accounts for 80% of the virus population yet it is not the greatest cause of nephritis. At the same time, some viruses like AIDS, SARS, Hepatitis and Herpes Simplex can be deadly.
