Nasa’s James Webb Telescope finds ‘fingerprint’ in space

A new image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope reveals concentric dust rings emanating from a pair of stars. Located just over 5,000 light-years from Earth, the duo is collectively known as WR140. WR140 includes a Wolf-Rayet star and a blue supergiant star swirling around one another in an orbit. The blue supergiant is an O-type star, one of the most massive star types known. The stars’ orbits bring them together about once every eight years. Like the growth of rings of a tree’s trunk, the dust loops mark the passage of time, producing the fingerprint-like pattern. Each ring was created when the two stars came close together and their stellar winds met, compressing the gas and forming dust. The image is part of new research that reveals how intense starlight can push matter around in space.
