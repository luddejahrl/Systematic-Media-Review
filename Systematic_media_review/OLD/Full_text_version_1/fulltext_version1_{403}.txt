The trial of a former Liberian rebel commander charged with committing crimes against humanity has started in a Paris court, AFP news agency reports.

Kunti Kamara is the first Liberian to be tried in France under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which recognises that the prosecution of certain crimes transcends all borders.

He is accused of rape, murder and torture during Liberia's first civil war in the 1990s.
