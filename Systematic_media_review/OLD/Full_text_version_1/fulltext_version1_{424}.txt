Suella Braverman is considering upgrading cannabis to class A amid concerns it has become a gateway drug for more harmful substances.



The home secretary has told allies she is on the same side as a group of Conservative police and crime commissioners (PCCs) who in recent days have called for the drug to be put on a par with cocaine.



A source familiar with Bravermans thinking said she is strongly opposed to calls to decriminalise cannabis, which she believes sends a cultural and political signal that using the drug is acceptable behaviour.

Rest of this garbage is behind a paywall and I can't be arsed to load my paywall avoiding plugin.



I think this line would be better written: 'A source familiar with Bravermans "thinking" said...'



Not content with frothing at the mouth about flights to Rwanda and people supposedly "gaming" slavery laws she comes out with this bollocks. She is an evil scumbag.
