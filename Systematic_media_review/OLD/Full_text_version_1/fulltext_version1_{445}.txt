A police officer was killed on Saturday morning at a hotel bar in Figtree while reportedly trying to end a misunderstanding between a patron and a bartender.

Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) national spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi identified the victim as Detective Sergeant Lovedany Madambi (39).

Asst Comm Nyathi said Madambi was stabbed to death with an unknown object by one Mthulisi Moyo (25). Said Nyathi:

I can confirm one suspect Mthulisi Moyo aged 25 years has been arrested in connection with the murder of a police officer, Detective Sergeant Lovedany Madambi which occurred at the hotel bar in Fig tree which occurred on the 8th of October 2022 around 2 AM.

Asst Comm Nyathi said the suspect has since been arrested.
