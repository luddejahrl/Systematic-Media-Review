SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, UNITED STATES, October 10, 2022 / EINPresswire.com / -- Remote working has exploded in the last couple of years following the events of 2020. Companies have been forced to re-evaluate their workforce strategy and how they engage workers. Adapting to remote work models has also allowed companies to engage talent anywhere in the world. Global workforces have subsequently become a mix of different types of workers. Companies often classify these workers as independent or corp.-to-corp contractors, as it can mean internal cost savings for the company. However, Governments around the world have realized that many of their working citizens are now providing services for multi-national companies outside of their borders. While excited that their citizens are working and participating in international opportunities, there is also growing concern about how these contractors are being paid and whether taxes are accounted for.In addition to contractor engagement, worker classification and structures are being examined for their adherence to compliance with laws and policies. Companies naturally donâ€™t want to put themselves and their contractors at risk, but without a compliance firewall, detailed knowledge of local employment, tax and banking legislation, many of these engagements are potentially at risk. With companies expanding overseas and utilization of global talent expands, it is essential that correct worker classification is implemented.The CXC Global Group of companies announce the appointment of two compliance specialists to join the North America and EMEA respectively to respond to the growing demand from enterprise clients and partners for compliance solutions around the world.Alex Taitz joins the North America team with a strong background in technology solutions and will work alongside the North American sales and operations teams to manage volume opportunities within CXC's client and partner matrix.
