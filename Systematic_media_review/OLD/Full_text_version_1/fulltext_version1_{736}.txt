History is full of myths, legends, fables, folklore, misinformation and misconceptions. Whether they have come about inadvertently or deliberately, many have become part of the public imagination. This book presents some of the most popular and enduring of these myths from the time of the American and French revolutions to the two world wars and beyond. Arranged within well defined geographical or thematic sections, and through a mix of short and long entries, each topic is clearly explained and the myth, error or controversy is exposed. This is an authoritative, compelling and illuminating miscellany, where you can find a straight answer to all those niggling questions about the past.
