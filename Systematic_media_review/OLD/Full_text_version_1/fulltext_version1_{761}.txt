As part of the hearing care industry, Phonak has closely monitored the rate of hearing aid adoption among the general public for decades. Over a span of time, we have seen only slight improvement in these numbers. As of 2019, only 31 percent of people age 45- to 65-years old with hearing loss use hearing aids.1 And, on average, these people waited from 4 to 6 years before purchasing their first set of hearing aids.2

In countries where the nationalized healthcare system provides hearing aids free of charge or at a minimum expense, the 31 percent rises, but only slightly, to 40 percent. When cost is taken out of the equation, what remains, at least in part, is stigma.
