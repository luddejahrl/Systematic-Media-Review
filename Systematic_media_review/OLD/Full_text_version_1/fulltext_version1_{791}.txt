My brothers and I were extremely close growing up, Sajid Javid writes for the Telegraph today.

The five of us were born within seven years of each other and shared the two-bedroom flat above the family shop in Bristol. We relied on each other and especially on my eldest brother, Tariq. We talked about everything, good and bad: girlfriends, doing badly at exams and who was going to tell dad.

In July 2018, Tariq took his own life. I was home secretary at the time and received the news from my younger brother over the phone. I was stunned. As a family, we simply had not seen it coming. His absence is painful for us all. I often wonder if I could have made a difference and helped him. It is a question I will never know the answer to, and one that always brings feelings of guilt.

The pain we feel in our family is, sadly, far from unique. In 2021 there were more than 5,000 suicides registered in England. Someone dies from suicide in the UK approximately every 90 minutes. I wish I could say the situation is improving, but the trends have broadly been going in the wrong direction for some time.

Today, as we mark World Mental Health Day, we can welcome the progress weâ€™ve made in reducing the stigma. But there is so much more to do, including on suicide prevention.

Sajid Javid: It's too late for my brother - but a better strategy could save many lives
