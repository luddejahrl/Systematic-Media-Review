[+]Show Abstract [-]Hide Abstract BACKGROUND: Cholera remains a public health threat for low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Asia and Africa. ShancholTM, an inactivated oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is currently in use globally. OCV and oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) could be administered concomitantly but the immunogenicity and safety of coadministration among children aged 1-3 years is unknown. METHOD: We undertook an open-label, randomized, controlled, inequality trial in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Healthy children aged 1-3 years were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: bivalent OPV (bOPV)-alone, OCV-alone, or combined bOPV + OCV and received vaccines on the day of enrollment and 28 days later. Blood samples were collected on the day of enrollment, day 28, and day 56. Serum poliovirus neutralizing antibodies and vibriocidal antibodies against V. cholerae O1 were assessed using microneutralization assays. RESULTS: A total of 579 children aged 1‒3 years were recruited, 193 children per group. More than 90% of the children completed visits at day 56. Few adverse events following immunization were recorded and were equivalent among study arms. On day 28, 60% (90% Confidence interval, 53%-67%) and 54% (46%-61%) of participants with co-administration of bOPV + OCV responded to polioviruses type 1 and 3 respectively, compared to 55% (47%-62%) and 46% (38%-53%) in the bOPV-only group. Additionally, >50% of participants showed a ≥4-fold increase in vibriocidal antibody titre responses on day 28, comparable to the responses observed in OCV-only arm. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of bOPV and OCV is safe and effective in children aged 1-3 years and can be cost-beneficial.

[+]Show Abstract [-]Hide Abstract Influenza causes significant mortality and morbidity in the United States (US). Employees are exposed to influenza at work and can spread it to others. The influenza vaccine is safe, effective, and prevents severe outcomes; however, coverage among US adults (50.2%) is below Healthy People 2030 target of 70%. These highlights need for more effective vaccination promotion interventions. Understanding predictors of vaccination acceptance could inform vaccine promotion messages, improve coverage, and reduce illness-related work absences. We aimed to identify factors influencing influenza vaccination among US non-healthcare workers. Using mixed-methods approach, we evaluated factors influencing influenza vaccination among employees in three US companies during April-June 2020. Survey questions were adapted from the WHO seasonal influenza survey. Most respondents (n = 454) were women (272, 59.9%), 20-39 years old (n = 250, 55.1%); white (n = 254, 56.0%); had a college degree (n = 431, 95.0%); and reported receiving influenza vaccine in preceding influenza season (n = 297, 65.4%). Logistic regression model was statistically significant, X (16, N = 450) = 31.6, p = .01. Education [(OR) = 0.3, 95%CI = 0.1-0.6)] and race (OR = 0.4, 95%CI = 0.2-0.8) were significant predictors of influenza vaccine acceptance among participants. The majority had favorable attitudes toward influenza vaccination and reported that physician recommendation would influence their vaccination decisions. Seven themes were identified in qualitative analysis: "Protecting others" (109, 24.0%), "Protecting self" (105, 23.1%), "Vaccine accessibility" (94, 20.7%), "Education/messaging" (71, 15.6%), "Policies/requirements" (15, 3.3%), "Reminders" (9, 2.0%), and "Incentives" (3, 0.7%). Our findings could facilitate the development of effective influenza vaccination promotion messages and programs for employers, and workplace vaccination programs for other diseases such as COVID-19, by public health authorities. Influenza causes significant mortality and morbidity in the United States (US).The US working-age group (18–64-year-old) bears a huge burden of influenza annually.Influenza vaccination coverage in the working-age group is low.Physicians and employers can influence vaccine acceptance of working adults.Employers can consider practical steps, e.g., incentivizing, or offering vaccine onsite. eng

[+]Show Abstract [-]Hide Abstract COVID-19 vaccination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) began in April 2021. A month later, most COVID-19 vaccine doses were reallocated to other African countries, due to low vaccine uptake and the realization that the doses would expire before use. Based on data available on 13 August 2022, 2.76% of the DRC population had been fully vaccinated with last dose of primary series of COVID-19 vaccine, placing the country second to last in Africa and in the last five in global COVID-19 vaccination coverage. The DRC's reliance on vaccine donations requires continuous adaptation of the vaccine deployment plan to match incoming COVID-19 vaccines shipments. Challenges in planning vaccine deployments, vaccinating priority populations, coordinating, and implementing the communications plan, disbursing funds, and conducting supervision of vaccination activities have contributed to low COVID-19 vaccine coverage. In addition, the spread of rumors through social media and by various community and religious leaders resulted in high levels of vaccine hesitancy. A strong risk communication and community engagement plan, coupled with innovative efforts to target the highest-risk populations are critical to increase vaccine uptake during the next phase of COVID-19 vaccine introduction.

[+]Show Abstract [-]Hide Abstract IMPORTANCE: Pregnant people are at high risk for severe COVID-19 but were excluded from mRNA vaccine trials; data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) are needed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the estimated effectiveness of mRNA vaccination against medically attended COVID-19 among pregnant people during Delta and Omicron predominance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This test-negative, case-control study was conducted from June 2021 to June 2022 in a network of 306 hospitals and 164 emergency department and urgent care (ED/UC) facilities across 10 US states, including 4517 ED/UC encounters and 975 hospitalizations among pregnant people with COVID-19-like illness (CLI) who underwent SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. EXPOSURES: Two doses (14-149 and ≥150 days prior) and 3 doses (7-119 and ≥120 days prior) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (≥1 dose received during pregnancy) vs unvaccinated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounter or hospitalization, based on the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for prior vaccination; VE was calculated as (1 - aOR) × 100%. RESULTS: Among 4517 eligible CLI-associated ED/UC encounters and 975 hospitalizations, 885 (19.6%) and 334 (34.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive, respectively; the median (IQR) patient age was 28 (24-32) years and 31 (26-35) years, 537 (12.0%) and 118 (12.0%) were non-Hispanic Black and 1189 (26.0%) and 240 (25.0%) were Hispanic. During Delta predominance, the estimated VE against COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounters was 84% (95% CI, 69% to 92%) for 2 doses within 14 to 149 days, 75% (95% CI, 5% to 93%) for 2 doses 150 or more days prior, and 81% (95% CI, 30% to 95%) for 3 doses 7 to 119 days prior; estimated VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 99% (95% CI, 96% to 100%), 96% (95% CI, 86% to 99%), and 97% (95% CI, 79% to 100%), respectively. During Omicron predominance, for ED/UC encounters, the estimated VE of 2 doses within 14 to 149 days, 2 doses 150 or more days, 3 doses within 7 to 119 days, and 3 doses 120 or more days prior was 3% (95% CI, -49% to 37%), 42% (95% CI, -16% to 72%), 79% (95% CI, 59% to 89%), and -124% (95% CI, -414% to 2%), respectively; for hospitalization, estimated VE was 86% (95% CI, 41% to 97%), 64% (95% CI, -102% to 93%), 86% (95% CI, 28% to 97%), and -53% (95% CI, -1254% to 83%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, maternal mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, including booster dose, was associated with protection against medically attended COVID-19. VE estimates were higher against COVID-19-associated hospitalization than ED/UC visits and lower against the Omicron variant than the Delta variant. Protection waned over time, particularly during Omicron predominance.

Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2022 Sep 21. , Creech CB,, Soslow J, Walter EB,, Dendy JM,, Campbell MJ,Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2022 Sep 21. [+]Show Abstract [-]Hide Abstract BACKGROUND: Data on medium-term outcomes in indivduals with myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination are scarce. We aimed to assess clinical outcomes and quality of life at least 90 days since onset of myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in adolescents and young adults. METHODS: In this follow-up surveillance study, we conducted surveys in US individuals aged 12-29 years with myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, for whom a report had been filed to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System between Jan 12 and Nov 5, 2021. A two-component survey was administered, one component to patients (or parents or guardians) and one component to health-care providers, to assess patient outcomes at least 90 days since myocarditis onset. Data collected were recovery status, cardiac testing, and functional status, and EuroQol health-related quality-of-life measures (dichotomised as no problems or any problems), and a weighted quality-of-life measure, ranging from 0 to 1 (full health). The EuroQol results were compared with published results in US populations (aged 18-24 years) from before and early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Between Aug 24, 2021, and Jan 12, 2022, we collected data for 519 (62%) of 836 eligible patients who were at least 90 days post-myocarditis onset: 126 patients via patient survey only, 162 patients via health-care provider survey only, and 231 patients via both surveys. Median patient age was 17 years (IQR 15-22); 457 (88%) patients were male and 61 (12%) were female. 320 (81%) of 393 patients with a health-care provider assessment were considered recovered from myocarditis by their health-care provider, although at the last health-care provider follow-up, 104 (26%) of 393 patients were prescribed daily medication related to myocarditis. Of 249 individuals who completed the quality-of-life portion of the patient survey, four (2%) reported problems with self-care, 13 (5%) with mobility, 49 (20%) with performing usual activities, 74 (30%) with pain, and 114 (46%) with depression. Mean weighted quality-of-life measure (0·91 [SD 0·13]) was similar to a pre-pandemic US population value (0·92 [0·13]) and significantly higher than an early pandemic US population value (0·75 [0·28]; p<0·0001). Most patients had improvements in cardiac diagnostic marker and testing data at follow-up, including normal or back-to-baseline troponin concentrations (181 [91%] of 200 patients with available data), echocardiograms (262 [94%] of 279 patients), electrocardiograms (240 [77%] of 311 patients), exercise stress testing (94 [90%] of 104 patients), and ambulatory rhythm monitoring (86 [90%] of 96 patients). An abnormality was noted among 81 (54%) of 151 patients with follow-up cardiac MRI; however, evidence of myocarditis suggested by the presence of both late gadolinium enhancement and oedema on cardiac MRI was uncommon (20 [13%] of 151 patients). At follow-up, most patients were cleared for all physical activity (268 [68%] of 393 patients). INTERPRETATION: After at least 90 days since onset of myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, most individuals in our cohort were considered recovered by health-care providers, and quality of life measures were comparable to those in pre-pandemic and early pandemic populations of a similar age. These findings might not be generalisable given the small sample size and further follow-up is needed for the subset of patients with atypical test results or not considered recovered.

[+]Show Abstract [-]Hide Abstract Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical cancer among women and is associated with other anogenital cancers in men and women. Prophylactic particulate vaccines that are affordable, self-administered and efficacious could improve uptake of HPV vaccines world-wide. The goal of this research is to develop a microparticulate HPV16 vaccine for transdermal administration using AdminPatch(®) and assess its immunogenicity in a pre-clinical mouse model. HPV16 microparticles were prepared using a biocompatible polymer and characterized in terms of size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency and microparticle yield. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were conducted to confirm particle image and to visualize the conformation of HPV16 vaccine particles released from microparticle formulation. In vivo studies performed to evaluate the potential of the microparticulate vaccine initiated a robust and sustained immune response. HPV16 IgG antibodies were significantly elevated in the microparticle group compared to antigen solutions administered by the transdermal route. Results show significant expansion of CD4+, CD45R, CD27 and CD62L cell populations in the vaccinated mice group, indicating the high efficacy of the microparticulate vaccine when administered via transdermal route. The findings of this study call attention to the use of minimally invasive, pain-free routes to deliver vaccine.

Vaccines (Basel). 2022 Aug 24;10(9). Bhatnagar N, Kim KH,, Park BR, Wang P, Gill HS, Wang BZ, Kang SM.Vaccines (Basel). 2022 Aug 24;10(9). [+]Show Abstract [-]Hide Abstract Adjuvants can increase the magnitude and durability of the immune response generated by the vaccine antigen. Aluminum salts (Alum) remain the main adjuvant licensed for human use. A few new adjuvants have been licensed for use in human vaccines since the 1990s. QS-21, a mixture of saponin compounds, was included in the AS01-adjuvanted Shingrix vaccine. Here, we investigated the adjuvant effects of VSA-1, a newly developed semisynthetic analog of QS-21, on promoting protection in mice after vaccination with the inactivated split virus vaccine. The adjuvant effects of VSA-1 on improving vaccine efficacy after prime immunization were evident as shown by significantly higher levels of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers and enhanced homologous protection compared to those by QS-21 and Alum adjuvants. The adjuvant effects of VSA-1 on enhancing heterosubtypic protection after two doses of adjuvanted vaccination were comparable to those of QS-21. T cell immunity played an important role in conferring cross-protection by VSA-1-adjuvanted vaccination. Overall, the findings in this study suggest that VSA-1 exhibits desirable adjuvant properties and a unique pattern of innate and adaptive immune responses, contributing to improved homologous and heterosubtypic protection by inactivated split influenza vaccination in mice.

[+]Show Abstract [-]Hide Abstract Objectives: This study assessed the associations between parent intent to have their child receive the COVID-19 vaccination, and demographic factors and various child activities, including attendance at in-person education or childcare. Methods: Persons undergoing COVID-19 testing residing in Minnesota and Los Angeles County, California with children aged <12 years completed anonymous internet-based surveys between 10 May and 6 September 2021 to assess factors associated with intention to vaccinate their child. Factors influencing the parents' decision to have their child attend in-person school or childcare were examined. Estimated adjusted odds rations (AORs, 95% CI) were computed between parents' intentions regarding children's COVID-19 vaccination and participation in school and extra-curricular activities using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Compared to parents intending to vaccinate their children (n = 4686 [77.2%]), those undecided (n = 874 [14.4%]) or without intention to vaccinate (n = 508 [8.4%]) tended to be younger, non-White, less educated, and themselves not vaccinated against COVID-19. Their children more commonly participated in sports (aOR:1.51 1.17-1.95) and in-person faith or community activities (aOR:4.71 3.62-6.11). A greater proportion of parents without intention to vaccinate (52.5%) indicated that they required no more information to make their decision in comparison to undecided parents (13.2%). They further indicated that additional information regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness would influence their decision. COVID-19 mitigation measures were the most common factors influencing parents' decision to have their child attend in-person class or childcare. Conclusions: Several demographic and socioeconomic factors are associated with parents' decision whether to vaccinate their <12-year-old children for COVID-19. Child participation in in-person activities was associated with parents' intentions not to vaccinate. Tailored communications may be useful to inform parents' decisions regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaccination.
