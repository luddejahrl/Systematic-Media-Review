NATO urges more weapons for Ukraine

The top NATO official, Jens Stoltenberg, called on allies to step up arms supplies to Ukraine, especially sophisticated air-defense systems, after Russia rained rocket fire on 19 Ukrainian cities in a marked escalation of its assault on civilians. Missiles continued to strike Ukraine yesterday, though in smaller numbers than on Monday.

Ukrainian officials called for weaponry that would allow them to build “an air shield for Ukraine.” In the past two days, Ukraine’s air-defense forces have shot down at least 66 cruise missiles and 40 kamikaze drones, they said, and destroyed all but eight of the cruise missiles fired at Ukraine yesterday. The death toll was 19 — surprisingly low, given the barrage, raising questions about the quality of Russia’s arsenal.

Leaders of G7 nations, outraged by the escalation of Russian hostilities against civilians, held a virtual emergency meeting in which they pledged more financial and military support for Ukraine and warned Russia of “severe consequences” if it used chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

Difficult choices: The global supply of the Soviet-style weapons the Ukrainian army is trained to use is running low. Finland and South Korea have been willing suppliers, but other nations, including Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Peru, have demurred.
