Next year they'll be selling new stuff for MW2, an expansion or something like that (not sure exactly what it'll look like but it'll have campaign stuff too). No actual new COD until 2024 as I reported earlier this year

For context, The Ghost of Hope had previously leaked that on top of the Map Pack for MWII, that it would also contain Campaign DLC: https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1579210143610175491

EXCLUSIVE: Campaign DLC to be released in late 2023 bundled with map pack I leaked previously.

So this is looking quite likely.
