Agaba alleges that the manner in which the ballot paper was designed shows that the election was predetermined and the candidates' names were not arranged in alphabetical order and instead all the declared winners were listed at the top of the ballot paper. He adds that his name, Agaba, appeared in one box with that of another candidate, Ategeka, on the ballot paper, which confused his voters.
