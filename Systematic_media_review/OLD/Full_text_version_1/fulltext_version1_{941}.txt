Buy a single copy of TOXIC or a subscription of your desired length, delivered worldwide. Current issues sent same day up to 3pm! All magazines sent by 1st Class Mail UK & by Airmail worldwide (bar UK over 750g and children's magazines with large free gifts which may go 2nd Class).

If you visit the website, you will find some exciting innovations on the magazine. There is a monster maker – a fart AND a burp machine, a wordsearch, as well as Free Stuff and Stuff to Win! (The magazine has all these as well – but with the magazine, you’ll have to make the burps and farts of your own volition. Unless you eat the magazine, and it proves particularly gassy going down. We’re not sure how gassy the paper is, we haven’t eaten it. If you do attempt this, please write in and let us know, and we will add this information to the blurb, as we like to keep our customers as informed as possible about the products we offer.)



What the website doesn’t have though is the piece de resistance, the magnum opus of Toxic magazine: the comic strip. We love this comic strip!



Read about the bad breath adventures of your favourite magazine editing team – yes, that’s right, not only do you get to read about the escapades of these grosstacular guys in the comic, they actually edit the whole magazine! Buy a single copy and gross out completely, or if you think you can handle it, subscribe to get fully grossed.
