"Suspected militants shoot at bus in southwestern Rwanda, kill two","













June 19 (Reuters) - Two people were killed and six were injured when suspected militants opened fire on a bus in southwestern Rwanda, Rwandan police said.

Saturday's attack, which killed the bus driver and a passenger, was carried out by the National Liberation Front (FLN), the armed wing of the anti-government Movement for Democratic Change (MRCD), the police said in a statement.

""Armed thugs, suspected to be remnants of FLN operating from across the border, shot at a public passenger bus,"" the Rwanda National Police said late on Saturday.

The police were tracking down the assailants in the incident on the Nyambage-Rusizi road in the district's Nyungwe Forest, they added.

The government has said the FLN had launched attacks from the Nyungwe forest area close to the Burundi border in 2018.

In April, the Rwandan government upheld a 25-year prison sentence for Paul Rusesabagina, who was portrayed in the movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" sheltering hundreds of people during the 1994 genocide, for his involvement with MRCD.

He was convicted in September on eight terrorism charges, which he denies.

"Rwanda – lasting imprints of a genocide: trauma, mental health and psychosocial conditions in survivors, former prisoners and their children - Conflict and Health","The present study examined mental health problems and psychosocial conditions in Rwandan families 16 years following the 1994 genocide. Its main aim was to investigate the impact of war, genocide and other potentially traumatic experiences on genocide survivors on the one hand and former prisoners on the other hand, as well as the respective descendants of both groups. The study also examined correlates of PTSD and the prediction of the PTSD symptom severity. In general, survivors and their descendants reported more traumatic events and proved to be more affected than families of former prisoners. Posttraumatic stress reactions were especially elevated in adult survivors who had experienced a high number of traumatic events, had poor physical health and were lacking in social integration.

Not surprisingly, survivors and their descendants, as the primary targets of the 1994 atrocities, showed the highest exposure to traumatic stressors with twelve and ten different event types, thus reflecting their exposure to genocide-related violence. These findings are in line with other studies conducted in Rwanda [4, 5, 9]. The average number of event types reported by former prisoners and their descendants ranged from six to nine events and was also mainly linked to the period of genocide, although both generations in this group emphasized its aftermath more frequently than the families of survivors. Former prisoners especially pointed to physical attacks experienced in refugee camps in the eastern Congo or related to the imprisonment upon their return. Their descendants often became witnesses of these imprisonments and the circumstances under which they took place. In this way, the past and recent political situations in Rwanda, which were marked by various episodes of persecution, attack, massacre, and forced displacement, were also directly reflected in the number of events reported before and after 1994. This furthermore highlighted the repetitive and cumulative nature of trauma in Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region, which is not only limited to genocide.

In the present study, 25% of the genocide survivors and 22% of the former prisoners were diagnosed with PTSD. In Rwanda, studies reported 25%-29% of PTSD in non-specified adult populations [6, 22, 23], 41%-51% in widows and genocide survivors [6, 7] and 37% within the Southern province of Rwanda [24]. Our sample therefore showed a lower level of distress than previously reported data on Rwanda, while also presenting a high trauma load. In addition, it is in discordance with data collected in the Southern province. These differences might be due to recovery over time [25] but might also be linked to differences in exposure to genocide within the same province. As stated by Straus [26], Gitarama manifested less “anti-Tutsi violence” in comparison to other Southern cities such as Butare or Gikongoro, and, according to des Forges [27], the nearby Kabgayi church offered special protection to a great number of Tutsi in the area. While in the present study genocide survivors and former prisoners significantly differed in their PTSD severity scores, this was not the case with syndromal PTSD. This was due to the fact that both groups manifested the same level of intrusions – the B criterion of the DSM-IV diagnosis. While this elevated level of intrusions seems unsurprising in genocide survivors, it needs further explanation with regard to former prisoners. The prisoners examined in the present study had spent about eight years in prison: some of them were incarcerated in the direct aftermath of the genocide and others upon their return from refugee camps, as only a few did not leave their home district in 1994. For those prisoners, to be put in prison might have felt like the point of no return as the accused did not necessarily expect to ever leave prison or at least not until the implementation of Gacaca jurisdiction in 2002. Adverse experiences throughout their prison time such as malnutrition, lack of appropriate health care, overcrowded detention conditions or physical harassment and attacks might have added new traumatic events to the already existing fear network [28], and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness over the years might have fostered and maintained intrusive symptomatology. Acute fear, one might argue, characterized their time in prison as well as the arrival in their respective communities as they did not know what to expect and how they would be perceived by others in this changed political environment.

Comparing rates of symptoms of anxiety and depression between survivors and former prisoners, the former showed a significantly higher level of distress. With regard to the HSCL score, 37% of survivors and 22% of former prisoners fulfilled the criteria for anxiety disorder, and according to the Bolton algorithm 30% versus 15% for depression. When relying on these results, our findings are consistent with earlier reported studies on survivors and widows or on the general Rwandan population [6, 7, 20, 23, 29], even though no comparable data are available for former prisoners. A high level of disagreement was nonetheless found when comparing prevalence rates gained either by using a cut-off score or following DSM-IV symptom criteria, as suggested by Bolton and others [20], to screen for depression. In a recently published study, Ertl et al. [16] critically discussed the unevaluated adjustment of a cut-off score developed in a different context – that is, for example, not appropriate to the given East African situation. Therefore, in future research, the HSCL might be better applied to investigate symptom severity instead of prevalence rates based on a specific cut-off value.

Suicidal tendencies were found in 25% of all survivors and in 7% of the group of former prisoners, occurring more often among women. Rates showed to be lower compared with an earlier reported study [7], but still displayed a considerable level of distress in a society where suicidal tendencies had not previously been commonly reported and were rejected by the majority of our sample as, to quote a participant, “an inappropriate way to solve problems for any Rwandan believing in God”. Alcohol consumption occurred twice as much in the group of former prisoners (15%) than in the survivors and was especially linked to males. This had not received much attention in earlier reported studies on Rwanda and is not easily admitted to by Rwandans, whose sense of disclosure prohibits openly talking about sensitive topics, even while the consumption of locally produced alcohol is a common phenomenon in rural areas and symbolic for good neighborhood relationships [30]. To further differentiate between general alcohol consumption and clinically relevant problems associated to alcohol and other substances, a recent representative study by the Rwandan Ministry of Health [23] examined a general population sample and found rates of drug and alcohol abuse ranging from 3%-6% and alcohol addiction of 5%-7%. Even while our data do not allow for any causal attribution, one might argue that these two specific features, suicidality and alcohol abuse, point to possible reactions and mechanisms for dealing with loss and trauma. Family dynamics might therefore be affected by these issues, especially if the broader family and community support is broken. Furthermore, it is possible that the experience of war and violence can lead to an elevated level of family violence, which often turns out to be moderated by alcohol abuse in a parent. Catani et al. [31] demonstrated an association between the father’s alcohol intake and maltreatment reported by his children in a Sri Lankan sample of children affected by long-lasting conflict. Although systematically collected data on domestic violence in Rwanda are scarce, another recent study reported that alcoholism ranges under the first three causes of aggressive and violent behavior towards intimate partners or children in this country [32]. Therefore, psychological disorders within the local population following experiences such as war and genocide, including alcohol and drug abuse, need to be considered in community-based interventions, which tend to diminish the risk of further violence on following generations.

Overall, the present study demonstrated a high degree of co-morbidity between diverse disorders, as postulated earlier [33–35]. Altogether, one quarter of all adult survivors suffered from PTSD, clinically relevant depression and/or anxiety, reflecting the serious mental health situation as well as the long-term consequences of massive violence even 16 years following the genocide [36–38].

With regard to the group of descendants, our study revealed that 16% of the descendants of survivors compared to only 1% of the descendants of former prisoners (and none of those born after 1994) fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of PTSD. In a study on a general sample of Rwandan youth interviewed during the direct aftermath of the genocide, Neugebauer et al. [39] reported a PTSD rate of 62%. Recent research on vulnerable groups such as orphans showed lower PTSD rates, between 24% and 34% [5, 7, 40]. With regard to those born before 1994, our sample of descendants of survivors manifested a similar level of PTSD to those reported by these last studies. Among these descendants, a particularly high trauma load was found and 50% showed to be half-orphaned. Their specifically vulnerable and life-threatening situation in 1994 and afterwards was strongly shaped by their families’ experiences. Due to persecution and death, parental protection throughout the period of violence was often missing. In the aftermath of the genocide, their families had to cope with severe circumstances and descendants often took over great responsibilities, which often continue today and might explain the ongoing sequelae of distress as depressive and anxiety symptoms [7]. The group of descendants of former prisoners within the present sample, however, differed even more from the youth described in Neugebauer’s study, though concrete comparable data is missing. Throughout the genocide, descendants of former prisoners did not necessarily flee with their families, but rather stayed at home or were individually sent to other remaining family members. When they had to take refuge with their families who were moving to the western parts of Rwanda, they often went in groups and the mainly Hutu background of their mothers offered them special protection in comparison to the descendants of survivors. Even if they had witnessed war and genocidal violence, they had never been specifically targeted, as the primary aim of the genocide perpetrators was to eliminate the group of Tutsi and their families [24]. Finally, information on what was going on in Rwanda in 1994 was scarce. A lack of cognitive understanding of the dimension of the events might therefore also have modulated the affect regulation and in turn have added a protective factor for those children [41]. Our data furthermore suggest that younger children born after 1994 did not specifically suffer from PTSD or other mental disorders. Further research is needed to better understand potential transgenerational effects of genocide on those children who did not live through the genocide in comparison to their older siblings [42]. Apart from these family issues, when referring to previous studies the broader social climate is in question as well, thereby demonstrating a clear association between mental health problems such as PTSD and feelings of hatred and revenge in the aftermath of conflict [22, 43]. These possible adverse implications also need to be considered while developing initiatives to foster reconciliation and mutual understanding.

Another key finding of the present study was that the number of event types as well as physical health and social integration explained the biggest part of the variance of posttraumatic stress symptoms in the parent generation. The presently observed dose-effect of the number of traumatic event types on the PTSD symptom severity score – highlighting the impact of cumulative stress on mental health – has already been widely discussed [44, 45]. The relationship between PTSD and lower self-reported physical health and other health problems has also been reported in previous studies [46, 47]. In a recently published study by Schaal et al. [7], both physical illness and trauma exposure were the two main predictors for PTSD symptom severity in Rwandan widows and orphans, while social factors were not further differentiated. The authors discussed this association as a possible difficulty of survivors with PTSD for developing effective coping mechanisms to deal with somatic and chronic health problems or, conversely, that the latter might affect them in such a way that they are no longer able to take care of themselves. Our findings demonstrated chronic pain to be the main physical complaint. With regard to the hypothesis that both syndromes mutually maintain each other as, for instance, acute pain proves to be mediated by symptoms of arousal and vice versa [48, 49], this offers an alternative explanation of why PTSD continues to occur at this level, even 16 years after the genocide. Recovery without any treatment or only basic medical-oriented services seem to be reserved to only a fraction of the population. While no evidence for direct prediction of PTSD symptom severity using economic factors was found, physical illness seems to function as a mediator between both, as its correlates with social as well as economic factors demonstrate. The direct consequences of genocidal violence such as HIV infection, chronic pain or disability, which were especially present in the group of survivors, have an immediate impact on the economic growth of a family in an already poor environment [50]. The respondents mainly worked as peasants, as is common for the rural Rwandan population. Therefore, as reported by an interviewed female survivor, when a widow was a victim of sexual violence during the genocide and, due to continued bleeding and other associated physical ailments, was no longer able to perform hard farm labor, her family’s economic status was subsequently and negatively impacted. Even if this kind of survivor were willing to receive psychological support, the challenges of the distance from home to center, money for travel and privacy from neighbors highlight the delicate interconnectedness of economic and social issues in this region.

The present study revealed that lower levels of social integration and activity were associated with elevated levels of PTSD symptoms, indicating a mutual maintenance effect. Interestingly, women in our sample had a lower social status than men, whereas no difference was found either between survivors and former prisoners or between widowed and non-widowed persons. One possible explanation for these results might be that especially vulnerable groups such as widows or genocide survivors infected with HIV tend to stick together and support each other, which is not necessarily the case with people currently suffering from PTSD [51]. According to our findings, genocide survivors had lost an average of 14 family members. In Rwanda, family and community support is crucial for the well-being as well as for the reputation and prosperity of individuals. Depressive moods and feelings of hopelessness in survivors, therefore, were often linked to this missing support, as reported by respondents. As remarriage is socially not necessarily tolerated, widows have difficulties taking care of their family in an appropriate way, especially when they are not further integrated in the community [52].

In comparison to this, former prisoners showed a better economic profile, but surprisingly no higher level of social activity and integration. In our study, while released prisoners rarely mentioned problems of reintegration following their release, their other family members such as their wives and children did. As Richters et al. [50] demonstrated, sources for ongoing conflicts might be found within families in which the father is extensively absent due to imprisonment. In such circumstances, the man returning home from prison may find that his wife has brought another man home or has even had children with other men. Additionally, there has been sharp economic decline and property loss – all factors leading to the father’s realization that he has limited authority in the new family system facing him following imprisonment [53]. Alcohol abuse and the aggressive behavior of released prisoners toward family members or, on the contrary, social withdrawal might also affect family dynamics. As several researchers have demonstrated, mistrust in the communities started to grow again after the first massive release of prisoners in 2003 in Rwanda, many of whom have since been presumed innocent or assigned to minor offenses. Alliances that had previously been made between, for example, genocide widows and wives of prisoners, were thereby once again put into question [54, 55]. A large portion of our sample of former prisoners was released within about the same period of time and therefore took part “in the government confession program” that provided a reduced sentence for perpetrators who admitted guilt and remorse [56, 57]. Released prisoners expressed being especially grateful to the government as well as for the introduction of the Gacaca tribunals, as most of them were released due to this new judicial initiative. At the same time, the majority felt that their own suffering due to imprisonment did not receive any recognition. Therefore, one can argue that social reintegration as a so-called aim of governmental-driven directions on how to behave when going back to their families and communities [56, 58] might not necessarily be experienced by the individual former prisoner. This also includes the notion of being innocent and a victim of “someone else’s war” [59], as, in the present study, released prisoners frequently reported physical attack or incarceration as their worst experiences according to the PSS-I. These results are in line with data from a recently published study on incarcerated, accused perpetrators in Rwandan prisons [9]. Only 13% reported their participation in murder as their most stressful event; Schaal et al. thus argue whether high rates of mental health problems in this population are in fact due to the causes or the consequences of imprisonment.

These results highlight the ambiguous and complex nature of victimhood in post-conflict societies as well as the need for further empirical evidence and lead to a first limitation of the study: comparing survivors with former prisoners seems critical with regard to its restriction in conceptualization. As emphasized by numerous authors, dichotomous categories are inappropriate when describing and reflecting complex circumstances of life in and after wartimes [12]. A dynamic view on participation is required whenever a better understanding of the role and participation in periods of violence is in question. People do not often fit to one category alone, such as victim, perpetrator or bystander, and can change throughout time in their concrete behavior. This change and assumption of different positions within the same period of time could, therefore, influence the impact on their mental health situation. Following Bar-On [60] there might be an association between the use of interchangeable roles and reduced moral responsibility in a person, which together could have a disburdening effect. Therefore, one individual who protected and rescued a nearby Tutsi neighbor (who in turn survived the genocide) while having also participated in roadblocks and manhunts for the Tutsi might be a conceivable example of how one person could incorporate many roles at the same time. Our findings might not necessarily hold for the whole Rwandan population. As already demonstrated, results from different regions might vary and our data can therefore only be seen as representative for central Gitarama. Still, they offer initial insight into a local population consisting of families of survivors and former prisoners living next door to each other who had never before been examined together and compared with each other. Another limitation lies in our definition of family. In Rwandan families, older children in particular do not necessarily grow up near their parents or siblings, but often refer to the broader family context including uncles, aunts, or even grandparents as their parents or to cousins as their siblings as well. The present study does not provide further information about the previous childhood circumstances of descendants in order to draw further conclusions on potential protective factors in the aftermath of violence. Finally, conducting research in a post-conflict setting demanded a critical reflection upon data validity. Due to political restriction and oppression, speaking out loudly is not common in Rwanda. The effect of introducing local interviewers also needs to be taken into consideration. While local researchers normally benefit from their close relationships to the cultural background in question, the specific historically shaped relationships between Rwandans might sometimes foster an even stronger mistrust between Rwandans than toward foreigners.",https://conflictandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-1505-7-6
“All Thieves Must Be Killed”,"Summary

The mayor said, “All thieves must be killed.” He said it was an order. −Witness to the execution of Fulgence Rukundo on December 6, 2016

Rwandan security forces summarily executed at least 37 suspected petty offenders in Rwanda’s Western Province between July 2016 and March 2017. Soldiers arbitrarily arrested and shot most of the victims, in what appears to be an officially sanctioned strategy to execute suspected thieves, smugglers, and other petty offenders, instead of prosecuting them. These killings, carried out by and with the backing of state agents, are a blatant violation of both Rwandan law and international human rights law.

Human Rights Watch also documented four enforced disappearances of suspected petty offenders between April and December 2016. The victims’ families believe the security forces killed their loved ones, but their bodies have not been found. In two other incidents documented by Human Rights Watch, in August 2016 and April 2017, authorities encouraged local residents to kill suspected thieves, and they did in fact beat the victims to death.

This report documents serious violations committed by the security forces in Rubavu and Rutsiro districts in Rwanda’s Western Province, including extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, and threats against family members and other witnesses to the violations. The report is based on 119 interviews conducted between January and July 2017 with 119 family members, witnesses, government officials, and others knowledgeable about the arrests and executions. Human Rights Watch has received credible reports of at least six other extrajudicial executions that it is continuing to verify, including some cases allegedly committed as recently as June 2017, and some cases in Rusizi district (Western Province) and Musanze district (Northern Province).

Most victims were accused of stealing items such as bananas, a cow, or a motorcycle. Others were suspected of smuggling marijuana, illegally crossing the border from the Democratic Republic of Congo into Rwanda, or of using illegal fishing nets. No effort was made to establish their guilt or bring them to justice. Instead of investigating the killings and enforced disappearances and providing information or assistance to the families, local authorities, including law enforcement officials, threatened some who dared to

ask questions.

Some victims were first arrested by civilian authorities who then took them to nearby military stations. Soldiers then executed the victims at or near the military base, sometimes after ill-treating them in detention. Witnesses who saw the bodies soon after the executions said they saw bullet wounds and injuries that seemed to have been caused by beatings or stabbings. One victim had been stabbed in the heart; another had a cord around his neck.

A man suspected of stealing a cow was arrested by local military and civilian officials and detained for a night in the local government office, where soldiers arrived and beat him and stabbed him in the leg with a knife. The next day, soldiers shot him dead. Soldiers forced another man to carry the remains of the cow he was accused of stealing on his back for more than five kilometers, with the cow’s head on his head. After presenting the victim to local residents, local officials, and the military during a public community meeting, soldiers then walked him to a nearby field and shot him dead. Another man was beaten to death for not turning up for community work he was required to perform.

Members of the military or the police killed at least 11 men on Lake Kivu in Rubavu and Rutsiro districts for using illegal nets known as kaningini while night fishing. There were survivors who described how they had jumped out of their fishing canoes and swam away from the approaching military or police boats. Those left behind in the canoes were shot dead by the officers.

In some cases, other security forces such as the Inkeragutabara, an auxiliary force of the Rwandan army, and the District Administration Security Support Organ (DASSO), a local defense force that supports the police, were involved in the executions.

These killings were not isolated events, but appear to be part of an official strategy. In most of the cases documented by Human Rights Watch, local military and civilian authorities told residents after the execution, often during public meetings, that they were following “new orders” or a “new law” stating that all thieves and other criminals in the region would be arrested and executed. In several cases authorities cited the identity of a recent victim and justified his or her killing based on the fact that he or she was a suspected criminal.

These killings, some of which occurred in front of multiple witnesses, are rarely discussed in Rwanda. Given the strict restrictions on independent media and civil society in Rwanda, no local media outlets have reported about the killings documented in this report, and local human rights groups are too afraid to publish any information on such issues.

In December 2016, a coalition of opposition political parties published a press release on several cases of extrajudicial killings in northwestern Rwanda, including some of the cases documented by Human Rights Watch. Soon after publication, the police in Kigali summoned opposition leader Boniface Twagirimana for interrogation on January 12, 18, and 19, 2017, and accused him of spreading unfounded rumors. He was not charged with any offense.

On July 5, 2017, Human Rights Watch wrote to Johnston Busingye, minister of justice, with copies delivered to the ministers of defense, local government and the head of the police, asking for further information on cases outlined in this report and requesting a meeting. The letter is reproduced in Appendix IV of this report and was not answered.

On July 5 and 6, 2017, Human Rights Watch met with five local authorities, including the mayor of Rubavu district and authorities in Nyamyumba sector, Nyundo sector, and Rukoko cell in Rubavu district and the executive secretary in Boneza sector, Rutsiro district. These authorities denied that killings of thieves or criminals had taken place, but one did say that people who illegally crossed the border had been killed for failing to stop when ordered to do so by soldiers, and that this was for security reasons.

The Rwandan government should ensure an immediate end to the summary executions of suspected criminals by security forces. They should also ensure that thorough, impartial investigations into these serious violations are conducted, including to establish how and with whom any policy originated; and that those responsible for the violations be held accountable. Victims’ families should be compensated for the unlawful killings.

The Rwandan government should also respect the presumption of innocence, ensure anyone accused of a crime receives a fair trial, and enforce without exception an absolute prohibition on criminal punishment for anyone not convicted in a court of law.

Recommendations

Methodology

This report is based on research conducted in Rwanda between January and July 2017. Human Rights Watch interviewed 119 witnesses to the killings, family members and friends of victims, government officials, and others knowledgeable about the arrests and executions. The names of victims are provided throughout this report. However, for security reasons, the names of witnesses and relatives interviewed by Human Rights Watch are not included in the report, and other identifying information has also been withheld.

Some initial interviews were conducted over the phone. These interviews were followed up in person between March and June. Most interviews were conducted in Musanze, Rubavu and Rutsiro districts, in Kinyarwanda with an interpreter. All interviews were conducted individually and privately. Human Rights Watch explained to each interviewee the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, the way in which the interview would be used, and the fact that no compensation would be provided.

Human Rights Watch wrote the minister of justice, with copies delivered to the minister of defense, the minister of local government, and the national police commander, with an overview of Human Rights Watch’s research findings and the details of specific cases documented in this report (see Appendices I, II, III, and IV). Human Rights Watch received no response to its request for a meeting to discuss these research findings or to specific questions about the government’s response to the violations documented here. In July, Human Rights Watch met with five local authorities in Rubavu and Rutsiro districts. Their response is reflected in section III.

This report focuses specifically on extrajudicial executions and other violations in Rubavu and Rutsiro districts, in Western Province, between April 2016 and April 2017. Human Rights Watch has received credible reports of additional cases that allegedly occurred closer to the publication of this report, as well as cases in other areas of Rwanda, including Musanze district, in Northern Province, and Rusizi district, in Western Province. Human Rights Watch is working to confirm these cases, and they are not covered in this report.

I.Background

Since the genocide that devastated the country and claimed more than half a million lives in 1994, Rwanda has made great strides in rebuilding its infrastructure, developing its economy, and delivering public services. But civil and political rights remain severely curtailed, and freedom of expression is tightly restricted.

The death penalty was outlawed in Rwanda in 2007. Before that, it was used sparingly by the state. The death penalty was carried out in connection with genocide trials in 1998 when 22 people were publicly executed, many after summary trials and some without legal assistance.

Extrajudicial killings, that is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process, also occurred. For example, in November 2006, police shot and killed three men suspected of killing a gacaca judge the evening of their arrest. In 2007, Human Rights Watch published a report on police killings of at least 20 detainees, many of which appeared to have been extrajudicial executions. In its annual report on Human Rights Practices in Rwanda, the US State Department expressed concern about the killings of five members of the Muslim community in 2016.

Attacks on political dissenters have also occurred, both inside and outside of the country. Since 1996 some Rwandans have been killed outside of the country after they criticized the Rwandan government, the ruling party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, or President Paul Kagame. Others were murdered, attacked, threatened, or died in unclear circumstances inside the country.

Civilians have also been held unlawfully in unofficial detention centers, including in military custody. In 2014, Human Rights Watch documented how at least 23 people were detained incommunicado for several weeks at Camp Kami, a military camp on the outskirts of Kigali. The detainees were later tried by a civilian court for security-related offenses and alleged collaboration with armed groups. A court in Rubavu acquitted some of them and ordered their release. Some former detainees told Human Rights Watch they were tortured while held at Kami.

Human Rights Watch has also documented a broader pattern of human rights violations against poor people, including petty criminals. Over the years, many such people have been unlawfully detained in so-called “transit centers,” where they faced beatings and other forms of ill-treatment. Human Rights Watch documented the death of one individual just after leaving one such transit center, in Gikondo, Kigali, and received information about similar cases in Mudende transit center, in Rubavu district. Most officials involved in such violations, mainly police, have enjoyed absolute impunity.

II.Extrajudicial Executions

The conduct of members of the Rwandan military, police and other state security actors in northwestern Rwanda has been as ruthless as it has been illegal. Human Rights Watch has documented 37 extrajudicial executions of suspected petty offenders in Rutsiro and Rubavu districts between July 2016 and March 2017, two of whom were women. Human Rights Watch has also documented four enforced disappearances, between April and December 2016, and two cases of individuals who were beaten to death by local residents acting on the encouragement of local authorities, in August 2016 and April 2017. The victims included suspected thieves, smugglers, and people caught or accused of using illegal fishing nets. Some of the family members and friends of victims admitted that the victims had been involved in petty crimes, while others said they were innocent and had been wrongly accused. The killings and enforced disappearances appear to have been part of a broader strategy to spread fear, enforce order, and deter any resistance to government orders or policies.

Government Strategy

Over 40 people interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they had participated in community meetings in Rubavu and Rutsiro districts where military officers or local government officials declared that thieves would be arrested and killed. Local authorities in Rwanda, including law enforcement officials, hold regular community meetings at the village, cell, and sector level. These meetings in general are not mandatory, but several residents told Human Rights Watch they felt pressured to attend. The meetings are not on a fixed schedule, but there is at least one per month after umuganda, mandatory community work held the last Saturday of every month. Participation at the meeting after umuganda is obligatory. Some of these local meetings were called after residents had complained about the high crime rate in their villages.

Several people told Human Rights Watch that they thought a “law” had been adopted stipulating that all thieves and other criminals would be killed, referring to multiple statements made by military and local government officials about the killings of petty criminals.

These warnings at local meetings that authorities would no longer tolerate illegal activity—such as theft, fishing with illegal nets, or smuggling goods across the border—began in early 2016. The cases documented by Human Rights Watch of extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances of suspected petty offenders by the Rwanda Defence Forces, the Rwanda National Police, DASSO, and the Inkeragutabara began in April 2016.

One resident from the Kavolo cell in Rubavu district told Human Rights Watch that local authorities delivered warnings in routine meetings: “In 2016, the authorities started saying things in meetings like, ‘We will kill people we catch stealing.’ It was usually the military officers who said this at cell and sector meetings.”

On April 26, 2017, Major General Alexis Kagame, the military commander of the third division, which covers the Western Province, participated in a public meeting in Gisenyi in which he said that people who illegally crossed the border between Rwanda and Congo fell into three categories: those who smuggle goods into the country and want to avoid tax, thus robbing the country of its development; those who smuggle drugs into the country and want to kill the youth; and those who have links to the FDLR (the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a largely Rwandan Hutu armed group, based in eastern Congo) and wish to destabilize the country. Kagame said that people in these groups were “enemies of the country” and he called on citizens to protect the country from these enemies. Kagame promised close collaboration between the population and the army to safeguard security. The mayor of Rubavu district, Jeremie Sinamenye, also participated in the meeting.

A participant at another public meeting on November 1, 2016, in Karongi district, organized by the Rwanda Governance Board and attended by many local leaders from the Western Province, told Human Rights Watch that Kagame said that all thieves would be killed.

A resident of the Rukoko cell in Rubavu district, near the border with Congo, described how soldiers stood up “without fear” during village meetings, telling local residents: “We will kill anyone who crosses the border illegally.” The civilian authorities “just agree,” he added; “they can’t contradict the military.”

Some witnesses spoke of lists that local officials established to identify those who should be killed. Two residents of Munanira cell, Rubavu district, told Human Rights Watch that military and civilian authorities organized a meeting in their village four days before the execution of Innocent Nshimiyimana, who was killed in neighboring Kiraga cell. The officer in charge of the local military post at that time said during the meeting, “Every thief has to be shot,” according to one of the witnesses. The officer also said that the security services had established a list of all thieves to be eliminated, according to the other witness. A resident of Nyabirasi sector, Rutsiro district, who saw the bodies of Jean de Dieu Habiyaremye and Pierre Hakizimana—two suspected thieves killed by security forces in November 2016—said he saw soldiers with a list that they showed to village leaders to tell them which individuals should be targeted.

A resident of Kanama sector in Rubavu district told Human Rights Watch: “During meetings in our region, the authorities said that the thieves will be killed. I was then afraid that I could be beaten because I’m a family member of [one of the victims].” The resident added that, in February 2017, a meeting was organized in his village by military and local government officials. The officials ordered all thieves to come forward and ask for clemency, and then said: “If you steal again, we will kill you.” Several people who were apparently innocent stood up and asked for pardon, in fear of being killed if they did not do so, the witness said.

Along the shores of Lake Kivu, similar warnings have been made about the use of illegal fishing nets (known in Kinyarwanda as kaningini). One resident of Bushaka cell in Rutsiro district told Human Rights Watch, “In local meetings, the authorities tell us to turn in local thieves. But they also talk about the [fishing] nets. They say the kaningini are not allowed. They say those caught with this net will be dealt with by the authorities.” Another resident from Bushaka cell said that the authorities’ warnings about the nets have become more serious since 2016. “Before they told us not to use them and that we would be fined if we did,” he said. “But now, the authorities tell us during the meetings: ‘Whoever is caught with a kaningini net will have problems with us.’” Another witness to a meeting in Bushaka cell told Human Rights Watch, “The soldiers told us at one meeting in 2016, ‘You have been thieves for a long time now. We forbid you from going into the lake with these nets. You want to steal all of our fish for yourselves? If you refuse to listen to us we will kill you.” The kaningini net has smaller holes than a legal net and can catch more fish. However, it can also catch young fish and therefore contributes to diminishing the fish stock, which is why it is considered illegal.

In some cases, local military or civilian officials accused the victims of collaborating with or sharing intelligence with the FDLR. A participant in a community meeting in Mutovu cell in Rubavu district told Human Rights Watch that a local government official had said that everyone who goes to Congo without passing through the regular border crossing would be killed, and that there is a high probability they would have gone to Congo to collaborate with the FDLR. Other witnesses told Human Rights Watch about community meetings where residents were accused of sending their children to Congo to join the rebels.

Extrajudicial executions were also used after the fact to serve as a warning to community members. In most of the cases documented by Human Rights Watch, local military and civilian authorities told residents after the execution, often during public meetings, that the suspected petty offender had been killed and that all other thieves and other criminals in the region would be arrested and executed.

On the same day as Emmanuel Nzitakuze’s funeral in Tangabo cell in Rutsiro district, local security and civilian authorities held a community meeting. Soldiers had killed Nzitakuze after accusing him of stealing a motorcycle on January 11, 2017. The meeting was held near the place where Nzitakuze was killed in neighboring Haniro cell, and a police officer leading the meeting described the killing as an example of what could happen when people steal, according to a witness. Residents present at the meeting told Human Rights Watch that they were not aware that Nzitakuze was a thief, as it was the first time they heard he had stolen anything. But, one witness said, “the military authority is very strong. You cannot criticize anything in front of the military.”

A resident of Busuku cell in Rutsiro district told Human Rights Watch that authorities often cite the execution of François Buhagarike, who was killed between October 19 and 20, 2016. “The authorities talk about his case in meetings. They say, ‘Someone who supports thieves will also have problems with us. Those caught stealing will be killed, like François. To anyone who knew François, if you steal, you will also be killed.’ All this was said by the military so it must be taken seriously. At the meetings, they intimidate us. They say, ‘We have guns and bullets, not stones.’”

Approximately one week after the killing of Amulani Bazangirabate, who had been accused of using illegal fishing nets, the head of the Bushaka cell held a meeting with local residents at his office. According to a participant at the meeting, he told those gathered that “people should not go out in the water at night alone,” and that “all fishermen need to be in associations in order to use correct nets. For example, Amulani and these other students were fishing illegally. They were killed because they used an illegal net.”

In most of the cases documented by Human Rights Watch, the victims were immediately buried by their families, without any medical examination. Several family members told Human Rights Watch that government officials forced them to do so. In some cases, police or family members brought bodies to a nearby hospital. An autopsy was conducted in a few cases, but family members received no information about the results and questioned the independence of the medical staff.

In many cases documented by Human Rights Watch, local civilian authorities were also involved in the extrajudicial executions, by alerting the military about suspected thieves, accompanying the police or military during the arrests of the victims, or by publicly expressing support for the killings. In one case, however, a village leader publicly opposed beatings by the military. The military responded that he should not have called them to intervene if he did not want the thief executed. They then shot and killed the victim, in front of the village leader. In the same case, the executive secretary of the sector also questioned the killings by the military. He lost his job a few days later. It is unclear whether this was related to his opposition to the extralegal execution; many local officials in the Western Province lost their job during the period covered by this report.

Extrajudicial Executions

Following is a selection of accounts from witnesses and people close to the victims killed by state security forces in Rubavu and Rutsiro districts. For a list of all the cases documented by Human Rights Watch, including the names of victims, the date and location of the extralegal execution, the security force responsible, and the offense the victim was accused of, see Appendix I. Details on the cases of enforced disappearances and individuals who were killed by local residents acting on encouragement from local authorities are included separately in Appendices II and III.

Jean Damascène Ntiriburakaryo, killed July 30, 2016

Ntiriburakaryo, approximately 44-years-old, was beaten to death by soldiers in Bubaji village, in Rubavu district, after missing umuganda, or mandatory community work. Ntiriburakaryo had stayed home to slaughter a goat. A resident of Bubaji told Human Rights Watch that when he and others heard that Ntiriburakaryo had been killed, they went to his home. As they arrived, they encountered the soldiers who had killed Ntiriburakaryo. “One of the officers showed regret for having killed Jean,” he said. “But he said they had no choice but to beat him seriously because he was against the state’s programs. He said: ‘This will give you a good example to never rebel against the state.’”

Jean Kanyesoko, killed August 2, 2016

Click to expand Image Jean Kanyesoko was executed on August 2, 2016 © 2016 Private

Soldiers killed Kanyesoko, 64 and a father of five, after he was caught stealing sugar cane near Kinihera village in Rubavu district. A family member of Kanyesoko said, “Because of poverty he would steal things. He would sometime steal people’s crops.”

A guard at the sugar cane field captured Kanyesoko and called soldiers stationed nearby, who shot him dead. The soldiers later called Kanyesoko’s neighbors to come and take away his body. One friend described what they saw when they arrived:

A soldier was standing next to his body. He said they caught him red-handed. He said, “The order to kill thieves has been given; take his body away and bury him.” Military officers continue to talk about him in cell and sector meetings. They say, “Those caught stealing will be killed like Jean.” I can’t go to meetings now because of this talk of killing criminals. They should just have put this old man in prison.

Innocent Mbarushimana, killed October 11, 2016

Mbarushimana, 20, was accused of stealing several bananas in Kabeza village in Rubavu district. A resident told Human Rights Watch what happened: “I heard people yelling that Innocent was arrested by the military and the Inkeragutabara. They were marching him through the village and saying that he had stolen bananas. A lot of people from the village were there watching, so I tried to go see what was going on. I heard that a decision was made to send Innocent to the sector office so they could investigate. But then I heard shots. Kids then came running and they said that Innocent had been killed.”

Another resident of Kabeza told Human Rights Watch that he tried to follow Mbarushimana to the sector office, but he was chased away by the soldiers. He said he was nearby when he heard the shots and that kids came running and said they saw an Inkeragutabara shoot him.

A third resident of Kabeza also tried to follow Mbarushimana when he was taken to the sector office, but he too was pushed away. He told Human Rights Watch that a child he knows came running after the shots were fired and said, “A soldier gave his gun to an Inkeragutabara and he shot Innocent in the head.”

Four residents of Kabeza who later saw Mbarushimana’s body told Human Rights Watch that he had been shot in the back of the head.

Pierre Hakizimana, killed November 28, 2016

Hakizimana, 35 and the father of five, guarded cows in Rutsiro and Rubavu districts. A local authority in Busuku cell in Rutsiro district accused him of being a thief, and soldiers then arrested him. People close to Hakizimana were told that he was detained at the cell office, so they went to visit him there the next day.

One of them told Human Rights Watch what happened when they arrived:

There were 10 of us, members of the family and neighbors. As we approached Busuku, villagers told us that they had seen soldiers take [Hakizimana] to a nearby tea field, so we went in that direction. When we arrived, we saw soldiers standing around Pierre’s body. One of them said, “Take the body and leave.” When we got to his body, I wanted to cry. But the soldier told us, “Do not cry for a thief.” I was sad and shocked; they would not even let the family mourn... A few weeks after Pierre’s death there was a meeting and the soldiers said, “All thieves will be killed. Look at what happened to Pierre.”

Jovan Karasankima, killed between November 28 and 29, 2016

Karasankima, 40 and the father of three, was accused of stealing a sheep and a lamb in Kavumu village in Rutsiro district. Local authorities and the Inkeragutabara caught Karasankima. The authorities told someone close to him that he would be brought to the police. However, members of the Inkeragutabara instead beat him to death. Witnesses who saw the body told Human Rights Watch that he had been beaten all over his body.[39]

Someone close to Karasankima went to the police in Kavumu and asked why no case had been opened against the killers. He said, “The police told me he was killed by the Inkeragutabara on the orders of the authorities of the cell. He said an order was given to kill thieves and then he told me to go away.”[40]

Fulgence Rukundo, killed December 6, 2016

Click to expand Image Fulgence Rukundo was executed on December 6, 2016. © 2016 Private

Rukundo, approximately 28 and the father of two, was detained by a local government official and six soldiers at his home in Munanira village in Rubavu district in the early morning of December 6. Witnesses to his arrest said he was questioned about a stolen cow. Rukundo did not resist arrest and was told he needed to show the authorities where another man accused of the same crime lived.

Later that morning a witness said he saw Rukundo walking towards the BRALIRWA brewery near the lake, where a meeting was taking place, carrying the carcass of a dead cow:

He had his hands tied in front of him and he had this cow carcass on his back and on his arms. The cow’s head was on his own head. Six soldiers told him to walk and there were maybe a hundred villagers following. I followed too. They took him to a primary school near the brewery where a meeting with the mayor of Rubavu had already started. The mayor was talking about the problem of thieves, and when we arrived the meeting turned to Fulgence. The mayor said that Fulgence had killed another person's cow. Fulgence denied it but he was not allowed to speak. He was just yelling, “I’m innocent!” But the soldiers next to him shouted, “No, you are a thief!” The mayor agreed with the soldiers. The mayor and the soldiers started to write on a piece of paper and then they each signed it. The mayor then announced, “This paper declares that thieves caught will be killed directly.” Some people applauded this; others asked for Fulgence to be forgiven. But the mayor said, “All thieves must be killed.” He said it was an order. When the meeting was finished, the soldiers walked Fulgence to a small field near a banana plantation. We tried to follow, but the soldiers told us to stay away. There were many of us following; some were primary students. We wanted to see what would happen. I heard Fulgence say, “I’m tired,” and the soldiers told him to sit down. They untied his hands and they took the cow carcass off of him… A soldier told him to stand up and walk and another soldier told us to leave. At that moment, I heard three shots. The soldiers then yelled at us to leave and we were scared so we ran.

Rukundo’s body was later taken to the morgue in Gisenyi.

Thaddée Uwintwali, killed December 13, 2016

In the evening of December 13, five soldiers arrived at the home of Uwintwali, a farmer in Murambi village in Rutsiro district. An individual close to Uwintwali said they knocked on the door and summoned him outside into the courtyard where they questioned him about a stolen goat and then started to beat him. The soldiers then took him away.

Friends and family started to look for Uwintwali early the next morning. Someone close to the family told Human Rights Watch, “We went over [to Uwintwali’s house] first thing the next morning. We were mobilizing to look for him when a man came and said he saw the body on the road about a twenty-minute walk away. We went there and found Thaddée’s body. He had been shot through the chest.”

Two weeks after Uwintwali was killed, soldiers announced at a Boneza sector meeting: “If someone is caught stealing they are going to have a problem with us.”

Jeannine Mukeshimana and Benjamin Niyonzima, killed December 16, 2016

Click to expand Image Jeannine Mukeshimana was executed on December 16, 2016. © 2016 Private Mukeshimana, 22 and a mother of one, and Niyonzima, 21 and a father of one, were killed after allegedly smuggling marijuana across the border from Congo to Bisizi village in Rubavu district. They were crossing the border with four other individuals, three of whom were also killed. According to local residents, Mukeshimana and Niyonzima were known in the community for smuggling goods across the border, including drugs and minerals.

Residents of Bisizi told Human Rights Watch they heard shots in the valley near the border with Congo in the evening of December 16. The next day, local authorities told residents to go to the border to identify the bodies. Someone close to Mukeshimana told Human Rights Watch what happened next: “When I arrived, I saw many soldiers standing around the bodies. One soldier said, ‘Look! But no photos! Let this be an example for you that those who travel across the border illegally will be killed like this. These people were transporting marijuana.’ I saw Jeannine among the bodies. I was traumatized.”

Another resident told Human Rights Watch, “We went to see the five bodies. Jeannine had been shot in the head. The message from the military was clear. They said she was smuggling marijuana and that this should be an example for the village.”

The same night soldiers went to Niyonzima’s home village, Kanembwe, and told the village chief in front of several residents that they had killed Niyonzima because he was smuggling marijuana.

Emmanuel Niyigena, killed January 25, 2017

A month after Mukeshimana and Niyonzima (above) were killed, 25-year-old Niyigena was killed in the same area. The bricklayer was arrested and then killed by soldiers as he came back from Congo. A witness to his arrest told Human Rights Watch: “When we had crossed the border from Congo and after we walked 50 meters inside Rwanda, we ran into four Rwandan soldiers. They stopped us, took Emmanuel and went with him into the bush. A few minutes later, we heard several gunshots. They had killed him.” Several other witnesses told Human Rights Watch that his face had been destroyed by multiple bullets. Soldiers later told the family that they suspected him of smuggling drugs.

Executions of Fishermen Using Illegal Fishing Nets

Human Rights Watch documented the killings of 11 fishermen on or near Lake Kivu in Bushaka and Gabiro cells in Rutsiro district and in Rubona cell in Rubavu district. According to family members, friends, and other community members, the victims were all killed because they had used illegal fishing nets, known as kaningini. The kaningini net has smaller holes than a legal net and can catch more fish. However, it can also catch young fish and therefore contributes to diminishing the fish stock, which is why it is considered illegal.

Local authorities, including military and police officers, had warned residents for several years that it was illegal to use these nets, but by 2016 the warnings turned to threats. A fisherman who uses a kaningini told Human Rights Watch, “In meetings the authorities would say, ‘Don’t use the kaningini.’ Then in 2016 they started to say, ‘We are tired of this. Whoever is caught will now have problems with us.’ But because of poverty we have no choice but to keep using the nets.”

The executions on Lake Kivu all happened at night when the victims were fishing from canoes. Several of the victims were fishing with other men, who survived the killings by jumping into the water.

Juma Ntakingora, 26, was killed on September 21, 2016, while fishing near Bugarura village in Bushaka cell. Someone close to Ntakingora told Human Rights Watch: “He was fishing with a friend who later came and told us that they had been attacked by the military patrol boat, that it just came upon them and the soldiers started shooting. We went down to the lake the next day and found his body. He was still in the canoe; it was along the shore. Juma had been shot in the stomach.”

Vedaste Renzaho, 34, was killed in late December 2016 while fishing. He was with another man, who survived the attack and later told Human Rights Watch:

We had been fishing for about two hours when we heard the motor of a military boat. Then we saw its lights. I said to Vedaste, “If you see a boat like that at night, it is looking for us; we should go back in.” But he said, “No, don’t be afraid. They won’t find us.” But when the boat got closer, I decided it was too dangerous. Vedaste could not swim. I said, “Ok, you stay in the boat.” Because I’m a good swimmer, I jumped into the water. I hoped that they would just take the net. I watched from a distance as the soldiers approached the boat. I heard one of them say to Vedaste, “Where is the other guy?” He said, “He jumped into the water.”… They looked at the net and asked why he used it. Then they shot him. They then took a big light and started looking for me, but I swam away.

Local residents found Renzaho’s body the next day, in his canoe along the shore. He had been shot in the stomach.



Alexandre Bemeriki, a fisherman and father of four, was killed in October 2016 after soldiers found kaningini at his home. Someone close to Bemeriki told Human Rights Watch, “Soldiers went to his house around 9 p.m. and took him outside. I saw them put his hands behind his back. They started to beat him and told him to bring out his fishing net.

Click to expand Image Alexandre Bemeriki was executed in October 2016. © 2016 Private

He was asking forgiveness… The next day we heard that there was a body down near the lake. We went to look and we found Bemeriki’s body. He had been shot in the chest.”

The village chief who was there when the body was discovered told Bemeriki’s family members, “You are poor and you can’t pay for an autopsy. So because you are poor, just bury him.”

As with other cases of extrajudicial executions, local civilian, military, and police authorities were open with community members about the killings and sought to use them as examples. A resident of Bugarura told Human Rights Watch about a meeting organized by the police at the sector office in late December, soon after Amulani Bazangirabate, 22, was shot dead by soldiers:

The police said that people should not go out in the water at night alone and that all fishermen need to be in associations so they use correct nets. The executive secretary of the Boneza sector then said, “For example Amulani and Nyumagabo could not be allowed to fish illegally. They were killed because they used an illegal net.”

Despite the risks, people continue to use the kaningini. One fisherman told Human Rights Watch, “They say not to use them, but we have no choice. We must eat. People still fish with it because they have no choice.”

Killed by Civilians after Encouragement from Local Authorities Human Rights Watch documented two cases of men killed by civilians after being told to do so by local authorities. There may be more cases of this nature as Human Right Watch spoke with people who participated in meetings in which this was encouraged. For example, one participant at a meeting in Nyundo sector, Rubavu district, told Human Rights Watch, “The mayor of the district told the population to stop keeping livestock in their homes, but the population said there was

a problem with thieves. So the mayor said that if there are thieves amongst us, we should

kill them.” Claude Barayavuga, killed April 27, 2017 Barayavuga was a 19-year-old with intellectual disabilities from Bahimba village, Rubavu district. He had a history of stealing in his community. People close to Barayavuga told Human Rights Watch that this was because of his disability. “If he saw sugar cane or maize that was ready to eat, he would take it,” one person said. “He did this because he was sick and he did not really understand that he should not do it. He would steal a lot.” On April 23, the village chief held a meeting and, according to a participant, told local residents: “I have been asked to give a list of criminals and thieves to the cell officials. I know there is one thief, Jean-Claude. If you catch him, kill him.” On April 27, Barayavuga stole two light bulbs from a private citizen who chased him down and beat him to death with a hammer. The police arrested the man suspected of killing Barayavuga, but he was released a few days later. Another resident told Human Rights Watch, “Claude’s death was sanctioned. Just a few days before he was killed, I heard the chief say at a meeting, ‘If Jean-Claude is caught stealing again, kill him.’” On May 3, the executive secretary of Nyundo sector held a meeting in Gatuvo, a commercial center near Bahimba. According to three witnesses, he told residents at the meeting, “the death of Jean-Claude is an example for all thieves.”

Threats to Family Members

In almost all the extrajudicial killings documented by Human Rights Watch, family members of victims were too afraid to seek justice, despite their right under Rwandan and international law to do so (see section IV). The reason for this was best summed up by the uncle of one victim: “Who could we accuse even if we wanted to? These men are killed by the state, and you can’t accuse the authorities of the state.”

Many family members were threatened when they tried to recover the bodies of their loved ones. The authorities told them not to inquire about what happened, and not to grieve. Some families buried the body in secret, to avoid any reprisals from the authorities. Several families left their villages when their husbands, sons, or brothers were killed, fearing that they could also be targeted.

“They told me they had taken [my husband] to the forest,” a widow told Human Rights Watch. “When we arrived there, we saw the soldiers and then we saw [the body]. The soldiers told us not to be sad and not to cry. They said if we dared to cry, we would risk being shot.”

“Since the killing, our community is very saddened,” a witness to one of the killings told Human Rights Watch. “We decided to keep our mouths shut; we cannot talk about this incident. We have no right to free expression. If we talk about this, we will end up in prison or disappear.”

In a few cases, family members of victims did try to seek justice, but they were discouraged by local authorities. The widow of one victim from Rutsiro district told Human Rights Watch that she sought justice in the village where her husband was killed:

I went to the police, and I asked why there was no case against the man who killed my husband. I was told that an order had been given and I was to go away. They told me he was killed on orders of the authorities of the cell. When the police told me to leave, I knew I had no choice. I wanted [my husband]’s ID but the police said, “No, it’s for us.” Now I don’t dare to return to get it. They scare me… When the police said, “the order was given,” I was so disappointed. But if the police helped to investigate and if I had money for a lawyer, I would file a case against those who killed my husband.

Most family members were simply too scared to inquire into the killings. The widow of one victim told Human Rights Watch, “The things I’ve told you I can’t say to the authorities because I could be killed as well. I live in fear. I don’t understand where this order to kill thieves comes from. But now I wonder if they will decide to kill the widows of men they accused of stealing.”

III.Government Response to Extrajudicial Executions

On July 5, 2017, Human Rights Watch delivered a letter to Johnston Busingye, minister of justice, outlining its research on extrajudicial executions in Rubavu and Rutsiro, highlighting concerns, asking for further information, and requesting a meeting. Copies were also delivered to the ministers of defense and local government and the head of the police. The appendices in this report were attached to the letter. None of these officials responded to Human Rights Watch.

On July 5 and 6, Human Rights Watch met with five local officials from some of the areas where the violations documented in this report took place. The mayor of Rubavu district, Jeremie Sinamenye, told Human Rights Watch that the reports of extrajudicial executions of thieves and drug smugglers in Rubavu were based on false information:

What the people are telling you is not true. We are preparing for elections and in this period, there are many rumors. These lies come from the FDLR and the abacengezi to destabilize the country. This is Habyarimana’s region and there are still people loyal to him in Congo. In Rwanda, we follow the law. If someone is suspected of a crime, they are taken to the police and they will go to court. The military do not participate in the affairs of the population. There is no new law saying that thieves should be killed. There is nothing of the kind. This is all rumors.

The executive secretary of Nyundo sector in Rubavu district, Jean Bosco Tuyishime, told Human Rights Watch he had only been in his post for three months and could not answer questions about the extrajudicial executions and other violations. He said the district mayor’s response to Human Rights Watch also represented his own response.

The executive secretary of Nyamyumba sector in Rubavu district, Elisaphan Ugiriribambino, also told Human Rights Watch that he was new to his post, he was appointed in March 2017, and that he had not heard about the executions of Fulgence Rukondo and Innocent Nshimiyimana. He said, “I do not think the military could kill people here. I think this is lies. There has been no order here in Rubavu to kill thieves.”

The executive secretary of Rukoko cell in Rubavu district, Chantal Mukeshimana, told Human Rights Watch that Ernest Tuyishime, Jeannine Mukeshimana, Benjamin Niyonzima and others were killed by the military while illegally crossing the border. However, she explained that these killings were not because of crimes they had committed or drug smuggling, but because they refused to stop when told to by the soldiers. “Instead they ran,” she told Human Rights Watch. “The military then had no choice but to shoot them; it is a security issue.” Mukeshimana told Human Rights Watch that she is not aware of any order to execute suspected thieves.

Etienne Nirere, the executive secretary of Boneza cell in Rutsiro district, where Human Rights Watch documented the killings of 11 fishermen between September 2016 and March 2017, told Human Rights Watch that while the kaningini nets have been illegal since 2006, nobody had been killed for using them. Human Rights Watch shared its research findings with Nirere, and he suggested that many missing fishermen presumed dead may have left for Lake Victoria, between Uganda and Kenya, for work. When told by Human Rights Watch of testimony indicating the 11 bodies had been found, he said, “Many fishermen drown in the water; the boats can be turned over by waves.” When told of testimony of wounds indicating the fishermen had been shot, Nirere said, “I don’t know about that, but the military and the police do not kill people.” Nirere told Human Rights Watch he was not aware of any order or policy to kill thieves.

IV. National and International Legal Standards

The rights to life, to bodily integrity, liberty and security as well as to due process and a fair trial, including the presumption of innocence, are guaranteed in the Rwandan constitution and international law. According to Rwandan law, a police officer may only use firearms when he or she has unsuccessfully tried other means of force, is subject to violence, or is fighting or arresting armed persons. There did not appear to be any threat to the lives of security personnel or others in any of the cases documented by Human Rights Watch. None of the victims were armed, and there was no evidence that any of the suspects had used violence, either when committing any crime or at the time of arrest.

The Rwandan Constitution

There is no legal basis for executions in Rwanda, judicial or extrajudicial, as the death penalty was abolished in 2007. In the cases documented by Human Rights Watch, no procedures were undertaken to establish the guilt of suspected criminals before executing them and statements and acts by soldiers preceding the killings denied a presumption of innocence.

The executions documented in this report violate several key articles of the constitution:

Article 12 states that “no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of life.”

Article 13 states that “a human being is sacred and inviolable [and] the state has an obligation to respect, protect and defend the human being.”

Article 15 states that “all persons are equal before the law. They are entitled to equal protection of the law.”

Article 29 states that “everyone has the right to due process of law, which includes the right: (1) to be informed of the nature and cause of charges and the right to defence and legal representation; (2) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent Court; [and] (3) to appear before a competent Court…”

International Conventions and Standards

International human rights law obligates governments to end impunity for serious human rights violations by undertaking prompt, thorough, and impartial investigations of alleged human rights violations, ensuring that those responsible for serious violations are prosecuted, tried and duly punished, and providing an effective remedy for victims.

Rwanda is a party to a number of international treaties (such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights) that strictly prohibit arbitrary deprivation of life, arbitrary detention, and ill-treatment of detainees, and that also require due process and fair trial. Under those treaties it has assumed legal obligations to deter and prevent gross violations of human rights, and to investigate, prosecute and remedy such violations. This also entails addressing the victims’ rights to justice and reparations.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) requires that governments adopt measures, including through the legal system, to protect fundamental rights. According to the UN Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body that monitors compliance with the ICCPR, a government’s failure to investigate and bring perpetrators to justice, particularly with respect to crimes such as killings, may itself be a violation of the covenant.

Similarly, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights places obligations on states to ensure protection of charter rights, and for individuals to have rights violations against them heard by competent national institutions.

Various international standards also seek to promote state efforts to obtain justice for victims. For instance, the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extralegal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions call upon governments to remove officials implicated in such crimes from direct or indirect power over the complainants and witnesses, as well as those conducting the investigation.

Combating impunity requires the identification of the specific perpetrators of the violations. Superiors may also be responsible for the unlawful acts of their subordinates, where the superior had effective control over their subordinates, knew or had reason to know of the unlawful acts, and failed to prevent or punish those acts.

In addition to the obligation to investigate and prosecute, governments have an obligation to provide victims with information about the investigation into the violations. The former UN Commission on Human Rights adopted principles stating that “irrespective of any legal proceedings, victims, their families and relatives have the imprescriptible right to know the truth about the circumstances in which violations took place.”

Under the ICCPR, states also have an obligation “to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy.” The ICCPR imposes on governments the duty to ensure that any person shall have their right to an effective remedy “determined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the state, and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy.” The state is under a continuing obligation to provide an effective remedy; there is no time limit on legal action.

The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials state that “law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others,” “only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives,” and that intentional lethal use of firearms should only happen “when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.”

America’s secret role in the Rwandan genocide,"Between April and July 1994, hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were murdered in the most rapid genocide ever recorded. The killers used simple tools – machetes, clubs and other blunt objects, or herded people into buildings and set them aflame with kerosene. Most of the victims were of minority Tutsi ethnicity; most of the killers belonged to the majority Hutus.

The Rwanda genocide has been compared to the Nazi Holocaust in its surreal brutality. But there is a fundamental difference between these two atrocities. No Jewish army posed a threat to Germany. Hitler targeted the Jews and other weak groups solely because of his own demented beliefs and the prevailing prejudices of the time. The Rwandan Hutu génocidaires, as the people who killed during the genocide were known, were also motivated by irrational beliefs and prejudices, but the powder keg contained another important ingredient: terror. Three and a half years before the genocide, a rebel army of mainly Rwandan Tutsi exiles known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front, or RPF, had invaded Rwanda and set up camps in the northern mountains. They had been armed and trained by neighbouring Uganda, which continued to supply them throughout the ensuing civil war, in violation of the UN charter, Organisation of African Unity rules, various Rwandan ceasefire and peace agreements, and the repeated promises of the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni.

During this period, officials at the US embassy in Kampala knew that weapons were crossing the border, and the CIA knew that the rebels’ growing military strength was escalating ethnic tensions within Rwanda to such a degree that hundreds of thousands of Rwandans might die in widespread ethnic violence. However, Washington not only ignored Uganda’s assistance to the Rwandan rebels, it also ramped up military and development aid to Museveni and then hailed him as a peacemaker once the genocide was underway.

The hatred the Hutu génocidaires unleashed represents the worst that human beings are capable of, but in considering what led to this disaster, it is important to bear in mind that the violence was not spontaneous. It emerged from a century or more of injustice and brutality on both sides, and although the génocidaires struck back against innocents, they were provoked by heavily armed rebels supplied by Uganda, while the US looked on.

The RPF rebel army represented Tutsi refugees who had fled their country in the early 1960s. For centuries before that, they had formed an elite minority caste in Rwanda. In a system continued under Belgian colonialism, they treated the Hutu peasants like serfs, forcing them to work on their land and sometimes beating them like donkeys. Hutu anger simmered until shortly before independence in 1962, then exploded in brutal pogroms against the Tutsi, hundreds of thousands of whom fled to neighbouring countries.

In Uganda, a new generation of Tutsi refugees grew up, but they soon became embroiled in the lethal politics of their adoptive country. Some formed alliances with Ugandan Tutsis and the closely related Hima – Museveni’s tribe – many of whom were opposition supporters and therefore seen as enemies by then-president Milton Obote, who ruled Uganda in the 1960s and again in the early 1980s.

After Idi Amin overthrew Obote in 1971, many Rwandan Tutsis moved out of the border refugee camps. Some tended the cattle of wealthy Ugandans; others acquired property and began farming; some married into Ugandan families; and a small number joined the State Research Bureau, Amin’s dreaded security apparatus, which inflicted terror on Ugandans. When Obote returned to power in the 1980s, he stripped the Rwandan Tutsis of their civil rights and ordered them into the refugee camps or back over the border into Rwanda, where they were not welcomed by the Hutu-dominated government. Those who refused to go were assaulted, raped and killed and their houses were destroyed.

In response to Obote’s abuses, more and more Rwandan refugees joined the National Resistance Army, an anti-Obote rebel group founded by Museveni in 1981. When Museveni’s rebels took power in 1986, a quarter of them were Rwandan Tutsi refugees, and Museveni granted them high ranks in Uganda’s new army.

Museveni’s promotion of the Rwandan refugees within the army generated not only resentment within Uganda, but terror within Rwanda where the majority Hutus had long feared an onslaught from Tutsi refugees. In 1972, some 75,000 educated Hutus – just about anyone who could read – had been massacred in Tutsi-ruled Burundi, a small country neighbouring Rwanda with a similar ethnic makeup. During the 1960s, Uganda’s Tutsi refugees had launched occasional armed strikes across the border, but Rwanda’s army easily fought them off. Each attack sparked reprisals against those Tutsis who remained inside Rwanda – many of whom were rounded up, tortured and killed – on mere suspicion of being supporters of the refugee fighters. By the late 1980s, a new generation of refugees, with training and weapons supplied by Museveni’s Uganda, represented a potentially far greater threat. According to the historian André Guichaoua, anger and fear hung over every bar-room altercation, every office dispute and every church sermon.

By the time Museveni took power, the plight of the Tutsi refugees had come to the attention of the west, which began pressuring Rwanda’s government to allow them to return. At first, Rwanda’s president, Juvénal Habyarimana, refused, protesting that Rwanda was among the most densely populated countries in the world, and its people, dependent upon peasant agriculture, needed land to survive. The population had grown since the refugees left, and Rwanda was now full, Habyarimana claimed.

Although he did not say so publicly, overpopulation almost certainly was not Habyarimana’s major concern. He knew the refugees’ leaders were not just interested in a few plots of land and some hoes. The RPF’s professed aim was refugee rights, but its true aim was an open secret throughout the Great Lakes region of Africa: to overthrow Habyarimana’s government and take over Rwanda by force. Museveni had even informed the Rwandan president that the Tutsi exiles might invade, and Habyarimana had also told US state department officials that he feared an invasion from Uganda.

One afternoon in early 1988 when the news was slow, Kiwanuka Lawrence Nsereko, a journalist with the Citizen, an independent Ugandan newspaper, stopped by to see an old friend at the ministry of transport in downtown Kampala. Two senior army officers, whom Lawrence knew, happened to be in the waiting room when he arrived. Like many of Museveni’s officers, they were Rwandan Tutsi refugees. After some polite preliminaries, Lawrence asked the men what they were doing there.

“We want some of our people to be in Rwanda,” one of them replied. Lawrence shuddered. He had grown up among Hutus who had fled Tutsi oppression in Rwanda before independence in 1962, as well as Tutsis who had fled the Hutu-led pogroms that followed it. Lawrence’s childhood catechist had been a Tutsi; the Hutus who worked in his family’s gardens wouldn’t attend his lessons. Instead, they swapped fantastic tales about how Tutsis once used their Hutu slaves as spittoons, expectorating into their mouths, instead of on the ground.

The officers went in to speak to the transport official first, and when Lawrence’s turn came, he asked his friend what had transpired. The official was elated. The Rwandans had come to express their support for a new open borders programme, he said. Soon Rwandans living in Uganda would be allowed to cross over and visit their relatives without a visa. This would help solve the vexing refugee issue, he explained.

Lawrence was less sanguine. He suspected the Rwandans might use the open borders programme to conduct surveillance for an invasion, or even carry out attacks inside Rwanda. A few days later, he dropped in on a Rwandan Tutsi colonel in Uganda’s army, named Stephen Ndugute.

“We are going back to Rwanda,” the colonel said. (When the RPF eventually took over Rwanda in 1994, Ndugute would be second in command.)

Many Ugandans were eager to see Museveni’s Rwandan officers depart. They were not only occupying senior army positions many Ugandans felt should be held by Ugandans, but some were also notorious for their brutality. Paul Kagame, who went on to lead the RPF takeover of Rwanda and has ruled Rwanda since the genocide, was acting chief of military intelligence, in whose headquarters Lawrence himself had been tortured. In northern and eastern Uganda, where a harsh counterinsurgency campaign was underway, some of the army’s worst abuses had been committed by Rwandan Tutsi officers. In 1989, for example, soldiers under the command of Chris Bunyenyezi, also an RPF leader, herded scores of suspected rebels in the village of Mukura into an empty railway wagon with no ventilation, locked the doors and allowed them to die of suffocation.

Lawrence had little doubt that if war broke out in Rwanda, it was going to be “very, very bloody”, he told me. He decided to alert Rwanda’s president. Habyarimana agreed to meet him during a state visit to Tanzania. At a hotel in Dar es Salaam, the 20-year-old journalist warned the Rwandan leader about the dangers of the open border programme. “Don’t worry,” Lawrence says Habyarimana told him. “Museveni is my friend and would never allow the RPF to invade.”

Habyarimana was bluffing. The open border programme was actually part of his own ruthless counter-strategy. Every person inside Rwanda visited by a Tutsi refugee would be followed by state agents and automatically branded an RPF sympathiser; many were arrested, tortured, and killed by Rwandan government operatives. The Tutsis inside Rwanda thus became pawns in a power struggle between the RPF exiles and Habyarimana’s government. Five years later, they would be crushed altogether in one of the worst genocides ever recorded.

On the morning of 1 October 1990, thousands of RPF fighters gathered in a football stadium in western Uganda about 20 miles from the Rwandan border. Some were Rwandan Tutsi deserters from Uganda’s army; others were volunteers from the refugee camps. Two nearby hospitals were readied for casualties. When locals asked what was going on, Fred Rwigyema, who was both a Ugandan army commander and the leader of the RPF, said they were preparing for Uganda’s upcoming Independence Day celebrations, but some excited rebels let the true purpose of their mission leak out. They crossed into Rwanda that afternoon. The Rwandan army, with help from French and Zairean commandos, stopped their advance and the rebels retreated back into Uganda. A short time later, they invaded again and eventually established bases in northern Rwanda’s Virunga mountains.

Presidents Museveni and Habyarimana were attending a Unicef conference in New York at the time. They were staying in the same hotel and Museveni rang Habyarimana’s room at 5am to say he had just learned that 14 of his Rwandan Tutsi officers had deserted and crossed into Rwanda. “I would like to make it very clear,” the Ugandan president reportedly said, “that we did not know about the desertion of these boys” – meaning the Rwandans, not 14, but thousands of whom had just invaded Habyarimana’s country – “nor do we support it.”

In Washington a few days later, Museveni told the State Department’s Africa chief, Herman Cohen, that he would court martial the Rwandan deserters if they attempted to cross back into Uganda. But a few days after that, he quietly requested France and Belgium not to assist the Rwandan government in repelling the invasion. Cohen writes that he now believes that Museveni must have been feigning shock, when he knew what was going on all along.

When Museveni returned to Uganda, Robert Gribbin, then deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Kampala, had some “stiff talking points” for him. Stop the invasion at once, the American said, and ensure no support flowed to the RPF from Uganda.

Museveni had already issued a statement promising to seal all Uganda–Rwanda border crossings, provide no assistance to the RPF and arrest any rebels who tried to return to Uganda. But he proceeded to do none of those things and the Americans appear to have made no objection.

When the RPF launched its invasion, Kagame, then a senior officer in both the Ugandan army and the RPF, was in Kansas at the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, studying field tactics and psyops, propaganda techniques to win hearts and minds. But after four RPF commanders were killed, he told his American instructors that he was dropping out to join the Rwandan invasion. The Americans apparently supported this decision and Kagame flew into Entebbe airport, travelled to the Rwandan border by road, and crossed over to take command of the rebels.

For the next three and a half years, the Ugandan army continued to supply Kagame’s fighters with provisions and weapons, and allow his soldiers free passage back and forth across the border. In 1991, Habyarimana accused Museveni of allowing the RPF to attack Rwanda from protected bases on Ugandan territory. When a Ugandan journalist published an article in the government-owned New Vision newspaper revealing the existence of these bases, Museveni threatened to charge the journalist and his editor with sedition. The entire border area was cordoned off. Even a French and Italian military inspection team was denied access.

In October 1993, the UN security council authorised a peacekeeping force to ensure no weapons crossed the border. The peacekeepers’ commander, Canadian Lt-Gen Roméo Dallaire, spent most of his time inside Rwanda, but he also visited the Ugandan border town of Kabale, where an officer told him that his inspectors would have to provide the Ugandan army with 12 hours’ notice so that escorts could be arranged to accompany them on their border patrols. Dallaire protested: the element of surprise is crucial for such monitoring missions. But the Ugandans insisted and eventually, Dallaire, who was much more concerned about developments inside Rwanda, gave up.

The border was a sieve anyway, as Dallaire later wrote. There were five official crossing sites and countless unmapped mountain trails. It was impossible to monitor. Dallaire had also heard that an arsenal in Mbarara, a Ugandan town about 80 miles from the Rwanda border, was being used to supply the RPF. The Ugandans refused to allow Dallaire’s peacekeepers to inspect that. In 2004, Dallaire told a US congressional hearing that Museveni had laughed in his face when they met at a gathering to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the genocide. “I remember that UN mission on the border,” Museveni reportedly told him. “We manoeuvred ways to get around it, and of course we did support the [RPF].”

US officials knew that Museveni was not honouring his promise to court martial RPF leaders. The US was monitoring Ugandan weapons shipments to the RPF in 1992, but instead of punishing Museveni, western donors including the US doubled aid to his government and allowed his defence spending to balloon to 48% of Uganda’s budget, compared with 13% for education and 5% for health, even as Aids was ravaging the country. In 1991, Uganda purchased 10 times more US weapons than in the preceding 40 years combined.

The 1990 Rwanda invasion, and the US’s tacit support for it, is all the more disturbing because in the months before it occurred, Habyarimana had acceded to many of the international community’s demands, including for the return of refugees and a multiparty democratic system. So it wasn’t clear what the RPF was fighting for. Certainly, negotiations over refugee repatriation would have dragged on and might not have been resolved to the RPF’s satisfaction, or at all. But negotiations appear to have been abandoned abruptly in favour of war.

At least one American was concerned about this. The US ambassador to Rwanda, Robert Flaten, saw with his own eyes that the RPF invasion had caused terror in Rwanda. After the invasion, hundreds of thousands of mostly Hutu villagers fled RPF-held areas, saying they had seen abductions and killings. Flaten urged the George HW Bush’s administration to impose sanctions on Uganda, as it had on Iraq after the Kuwait invasion earlier that year. But unlike Saddam Hussein, who was routed from Kuwait, Museveni received only Gribbin’s “stiff questions” about the RPF’s invasion of Rwanda.

“In short,” Gribbin writes, “we said that the cat was out of the bag, and neither the United States nor Uganda was going to rebag it.” Sanctioning Museveni might have harmed US interests in Uganda, he explains. “We sought a stable nation after years of violence and uncertainty. We encouraged nascent democratic initiatives. We supported a full range of economic reforms.”

But the US was not fostering nascent democratic initiatives inside Uganda. While pressuring other countries, including Rwanda, to open up political space, Uganda’s donors were allowing Museveni to ban political party activity, arrest journalists and editors, and conduct brutal counterinsurgency operations in which civilians were tortured and killed. And far from seeking stability, the US, by allowing Uganda to arm the RPF, was setting the stage for what would turn out to be the worst outbreak of violence ever recorded on the African continent. Years later, Cohen expressed regret for failing to pressure Uganda to stop supporting the RPF, but by then it was far too late.

For Habyarimana and his circle of Hutu elites, the RPF invasion seemed to have a silver lining, at least at first. At the time, Hutu/Tutsi relations inside Rwanda had improved. Habyarimana had sought reconciliation with the Tutsis still living in Rwanda by reserving civil service jobs and university places for them in proportion to their share of the population. This programme was modestly successful, and the greatest tensions in the country now lay along class, not ethnic, lines. A tiny educated Hutu clique linked to Habyarimana’s family who called themselves évolués –the evolved ones – was living off the labour of millions of impoverished rural Hutus, whom they exploited just as brutally as the Tutsi overlords of bygone days.

The évolués subjected the peasants to forced labour and fattened themselves on World Bank “anti-poverty” projects that provided jobs and other perks for their own group, but did little to alleviate poverty. International aid donors had pressured Habyarimana to allow opposition political parties to operate, and many new ones had sprung up. Hutus and Tutsis were increasingly united in criticising Habyarimana’s autocratic behaviour and nepotism, and the vast economic inequalities in the country.

When Rwanda’s ethnic bonfires roared back to life in the days after the RPF invasion, Habyarimana and his circle seem to have sensed a political opportunity: now they could distract the disaffected Hutu masses from their own abuses by reawakening fears of the “demon Tutsis”, who would soon become convenient scapegoats to divert attention from profound socioeconomic injustices.

Shortly after the invasion, all Tutsis – whether RPF supporters or not – became targets of a vicious propaganda campaign that would bear hideous fruit in April 1994. Chauvinist Hutu newspapers, magazines and radio programmes began reminding Hutu audiences that they were the original occupants of the Great Lakes region and that Tutsis were Nilotics – supposedly warlike pastoralists from Ethiopia who had conquered and enslaved them in the 17th century. The RPF invasion was nothing more than a plot by Museveni, Kagame and their Tutsi co-conspirators to re-establish this evil Nilotic empire. Cartoons of Tutsis killing Hutus began appearing in magazines, along with warnings that all Tutsis were RPF spies bent on dragging the country back to the days when the Tutsi queen supposedly rose from her seat supported by swords driven between the shoulders of Hutu children. In December 1993, a picture of a machete appeared on the front page of a Hutu publication under the headline “What to do about the Tutsis?”

Habyarimana knew that the RPF, thanks to Ugandan backing, was better armed, trained and disciplined than his own army. Under immense international pressure, he had agreed in August 1993 to grant the RPF seats in a transitional government and nearly half of all posts in the army. Even Tutsis inside Rwanda were against giving the RPF so much power because they knew it could provoke the angry, fearful Hutus even more, and they were right. As Habyarimana’s increasingly weak government reluctantly acceded to the RPF’s demands for power, Hutu extremist mayors and other local officials began stockpiling rifles, and government-linked anti-Tutsi militia groups began distributing machetes and kerosene to prospective génocidaires. In January 1994, four months before the genocide, the CIA predicted that if tensions were not somehow defused, hundreds of thousands of people would die in ethnic violence. The powder keg awaited a spark to set it off.

That spark arrived at about 8pm on 6 April 1994, when rockets fired from positions close to Kigali airport shot down Habyarimana’s plane as it was preparing to land. The next morning, frantic Hutu militia groups, convinced that the Nilotic apocalypse was at hand, launched a ferocious attack against their Tutsi neighbours.

Few subjects are more polarising than the modern history of Rwanda. Questions such as “Has the RPF committed human rights abuses?” or “Who shot down President Habyarimana’s plane?” have been known to trigger riots at academic conferences. The Rwandan government bans and expels critical scholars from the country, labelling them “enemies of Rwanda” and “genocide deniers”, and Kagame has stated that he doesn’t think that “anyone in the media, UN [or] human rights organisations has any moral right whatsoever to level any accusations against me or Rwanda”.

Be that as it may, several lines of evidence suggest that the RPF was responsible for the downing of Habyarimana’s plane. The missiles used were Russian-made SA-16s. The Rwandan army was not known to possess these weapons, but the RPF had them at least since May 1991. Two SA-16 single-use launchers were also found in a valley near Masaka Hill, an area within range of the airport that was accessible to the RPF. According to the Russian military prosecutor’s office, the launchers had been sold to Uganda by the USSR in 1987.

Since 1997, five additional investigations of the crash have been carried out, including one by a UN-appointed team, and one each by French and Spanish judges working independently. These three concluded that the RPF was probably responsible. Two Rwandan government investigations conversely concluded that Hutu elites and members of Habyarimana’s own army were responsible.

A 2012 report on the crash commissioned by two French judges supposedly exonerated the RPF. But this report, although widely publicised as definitive, actually was not. The authors used ballistic and acoustic evidence to argue that the missiles were probably fired by the Rwandan army from Kanombe military barracks. But they admit that their technical findings could not exclude the possibility that the missiles were fired from Masaka Hill, where the launchers were found. The report also fails to explain how the Rwandan army, which was not known to possess SA-16s, could have shot down the plane using them.

Soon after the plane crash, the génocidaires began their attack against the Tutsis, and the RPF began advancing. But the rebels’ troop movements suggested that their primary priority was conquering the country, not saving Tutsi civilians. Rather than heading south, where most of the killings were taking place, the RPF circled around Kigali. By the time it reached the capital weeks later, most of the Tutsis there were dead.

When the UN peacekeeper Dallaire met RPF commander Kagame during the genocide, he asked about the delay. “He knew full well that every day of fighting on the periphery meant certain death for Tutsis still behind [Rwanda government forces] lines,” Dallaire wrote in Shake Hands With the Devil. “[Kagame] ignored the implications of my question.”

In the years that followed, Bill Clinton apologised numerous times for the US’s inaction during the genocide. “If we’d gone in sooner, I believe we could have saved at least a third of the lives that were lost,” he told journalist Tania Bryer in 2013. Instead, Europeans and Americans extracted their own citizens and the UN peacekeepers quietly withdrew. But Dallaire indicates that Kagame would have rejected Clinton’s help in any case. “The international community is looking at sending an intervention force on humanitarian grounds,” Kagame told Dallaire. “But for what reason? If an intervention force is sent to Rwanda, we,” – meaning the RPF – “will fight it.”

As the RPF advanced, Hutu refugees fled into neighbouring countries. In late April, television stations around the world broadcast images of thousands upon thousands of them crossing the Rusumo Bridge from Rwanda into Tanzania, as the bloated corpses of Rwandans floated down the Kagera river beneath them. Most viewers assumed that all the corpses were Tutsis killed by Hutu génocidaires. But the river drains mainly from areas then held by the RPF, and Mark Prutsalis, a UN official working in the Tanzanian refugee camps, maintains that at least some of the bodies were probably Hutu victims of reprisal killings by the RPF. One refugee after another told him that RPF soldiers had gone house to house in Hutu areas, dragging people out, tying them up and throwing them in the river. The UN estimated later that the RPF killed some 10,000 civilians each month during the genocide.

Lawrence Nsereko was among the journalists on the Rusumo Bridge that day and as the bodies floated by, he noticed something strange. The upper arms of some of them had been tied with ropes behind their backs. In Uganda, this method of restraint is known as the “three-piece tie”; it puts extreme pressure on the breastbone, causing searing pain, and may result in gangrene. Amnesty International had recently highlighted it as a signature torture method of Museveni’s army, and Lawrence wondered whether the RPF had learned this technique from their Ugandan patrons.

In June 1994, while the slaughter in Rwanda was still underway, Museveni travelled to Minneapolis, where he received a Hubert H Humphrey public service medal and honorary doctorate from the University of Minnesota. The dean, a former World Bank official, praised Museveni for ending human rights abuses in Uganda and preparing his country for multiparty democracy. Western journalists and academics showered Museveni with praise. “Uganda [is] one of the few flickers of hope for the future of black Africa,” wrote one. The New York Times compared the Ugandan leader to Nelson Mandela, and Time magazine hailed him as a “herdsman and philosopher” and “central Africa’s intellectual compass.”

Museveni also visited Washington on that trip, where he met with Clinton and his national security adviser, Anthony Lake. I could find no record of what the men discussed, but I can imagine the Americans lamenting the tragedy in Rwanda, and the Ugandan explaining that this disaster only confirmed his long-held theory that Africans were too attached to clan loyalties for multiparty democracy. The continent’s ignorant peasants belonged under the control of autocrats like himself.

Rwandan opposition leader found dead,"A senior member of a Rwandan political party has been murdered in the third attack on a government critic in a month.

Andre Kagwa Rwisereka, vice-president of the Democratic Green party, which was unable to gain registration to contest next month's presidential election, was found near a river close to Butare, in southern Rwanda. He had been reported missing on Tuesday.

""His head was almost completely removed from his body. His brother, Antoine Haguma, confirms seeing the dead body,"" said Frank Habineza, the party president.

Police confirmed the death and said a machete was found near the victim, who had also suffered chest wounds.

Eric Kayiranga, a police spokesman, said Rwisereka had reportedly been carrying a lot of money and robbery may have been the motive.

The murder follows the killing in Rwanda on 24 June of Jean Leonard Rugambage, acting editor of the Umuvugizi newspaper.

The government suspended the paper for six months in April for ""inciting insubordination in the army and police"" and publishing ""information that endangers public order"". Five days earlier, the former Rwandan army chief Lieutenant General Kayumba Nyamwasa, who had fallen out with President Paul Kagame, was shot in the stomach in South Africa.

Both the exiled Umuvugizi editor and Nyamwasa's wife accused the Rwandan government of being behind the attacks. The government has vigorously denied this, and there is no evidence of its involvement.

But human rights groups have accused Kagame's regime of clamping down on political opponents and the independent media in recent months. On Tuesday, the press watchdog Reporters Without Borders called on the European Union and other donors to suspend financial support for the election because of ""a series of grave press freedom violations"".

""How much longer will the international community continue to endorse this repressive regime?"" the organisation said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/14/rwanda-opposition-politician-found-dead
Some mosquitoes already have resistance to the latest weapon against malaria,"An insecticide about to be widely deployed inside African homes to combat malaria-carrying mosquitoes is already losing its punch. Two years ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the green light for clothianidin, long used in agriculture to kill crop pests, to be added to the current mainstays of indoor mosquito control, which are losing their effectiveness as the insects develop resistance. Since then, many African countries have been laying plans to spray the walls of homes with the pesticide—it would represent the first new class of chemicals adopted for such use in decades—and looking anxiously for evidence of pre-existing resistance.

Now, scientists at Cameroon's Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases (CRID) have found it. They recently sampled mosquitoes from rural and urban areas around Yaoundé, the capital, including two key malaria carriers. In one standard susceptibility assay, exposure to clothianidin for 1 hour killed 100% of Anopheles coluzzii. But in some A. gambiae samples as many as 55% of the mosquitoes survived, the group reported in a preprint posted 7 August on the bioRxiv preprint server.

Corine Ngufor, a medical entomologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, says this appears to be the first report of clear resistance to clothianidin in malaria-carrying insects. ""It may spread very quickly and make this new class of insecticide almost useless for malaria vector control within a few years,"" she warns.

Colince Kamdem, the CRID research scientist who led the study, says agricultural use of neonicotinoids—the class of chemicals to which clothianidin belongs—likely drove the emergence of the resistant mosquito strains. ""WHO would never have recommended this insecticide if such data were available,"" he contends.

Tiaan de Jager, director of the University of Pretoria Institute for Sustainable Malaria Control in South Africa, says the study shows it is crucial to test malaria vectors for resistance to an insecticide before deploying it. ""It proves how important it is to tailor control methods to a region, such as an area of high agriculture, to ensure the success of the methods and overall program,"" he says. ""Other novel insecticide chemistries are urgently needed for malaria vector control,"" Ngufor adds.

Bed nets coated with long-lasting insecticides and indoor spraying have helped halve malaria mortality and morbidity in the past 2 decades. These programs used insecticides from four classes but relied heavily on pyrethroids because they are cheap and nontoxic to mammals including humans, Kamdem says.

To combat the rise of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes, WHO added clothianidin to its ""prequalified"" list of chemicals acceptable for indoor spraying (and potentially nets). Neonicotinoids have become increasingly controversial as agricultural pesticides because of their impacts on pollinators; Europe has banned their use in agriculture. But farms in Cameroon and elsewhere in Africa rely heavily on them. In agricultural areas, Kamdem says, pesticide residues contaminate standing water that serves as breeding sites for mosquito larvae, favoring the evolution of neonicotinoid resistance.

The Cameroon finding doesn't surprise German life science company Bayer AG, which manufactures one of the two formulations of clothianidin that malaria programs are considering for indoor spraying. ""We supported some work in Côte d'Ivoire to also explore this and it seemed to suggest the same kind of finding, that there was already resistance to the family of insecticides that clothianidin belongs to,"" says Sebastian Horstmann, Bayer's product development manager for the clothianidin formulation. Horstmann says that to thwart, or at least slow, resistance, Bayer is developing new formulations with multiple insecticides for indoor spraying. But Kamdem notes those combinations have yet to be tested on resistant mosquitoes because none had been identified until now.

WHO has not reviewed the study because it has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, says Deusdedit Mubangizi, who coordinates the agency's ""prequalification"" assessments of active pharmaceutical products and medicines including insecticides used for mosquito control. But he thinks the chemical could still be an asset in mosquito control. ""Resistance to clothianidin is much less prevalent than to other alternative insecticides in current use,"" he says. But how long that will last is the great unknown—and concern.",https://www.science.org/content/article/some-mosquitoes-already-have-resistance-latest-weapon-against-malaria
"FEATURE: After two decades, genocide survivor opens up about her anger and forgiveness","Her relatives are among the estimated 800,000 people who were systematically murdered throughout the country. The vast majority were Tutsi, but moderate Hutu, Twa and others were also targeted.

Starting on 7 April, the genocide lasted 100 days, ending on 4 July – which is considered Rwanda’s “Liberation Day.”

Ahead of that Day, Ms. Umuhoza, now 36-years-old and living with her three young children in the United States, shared her remarkable story with the UN News Centre.

UN News Centre: Tell me about what happened to your family.

Frida Umuhoza: It was the 7th of May, 1994, in my village of Nyanza, about two hours from the capital, Kigali, and my family already knew that we were in trouble. We’d been running around already for the whole month. So, very early on that morning, when we heard our neighbour’s children crying, we knew. We were about 18 people in total, hiding in my grandfather’s house: my mom, my brothers, my aunties and some of their extended families and my grandparents. We were just praying in that room. When we heard the screaming of the neighbours, heard them saying “Oh please forgive me. I will never be a Tutsi again” we knew what was coming, but we couldn’t run away.

My father was hiding on the roof. He’d been there for days. And then we saw this young man coming in the room. He came in, and he had blood on his clothes and a machete in his hands. When we saw him we were all scared and we covered our faces. I think he must have had a little bit of compassion left in him, because he went out and told the group that we were not there. But the guy that was leading the group did not believe him. So he came in the room. And when he saw us he just mocked “Oh, you mean you wanted to save these cockroaches and snakes. There are so many of them!”

Then he told us to come outside. We were hiding behind my grandfather, who had nothing to help us but a Bible in his hands. My father, who was hiding on the roof, could hear everything that was going on but could not come down. We were then led to a ditch right behind the house where my father was hiding. That was where we were given a chance to choose what was going to kill us. You had a choice between a spear, a club, a machete or a knife. But there were no bullets, because in my village, to be shot, you had to pay. They said we were too cheap for a bullet. My grandfather tried to beg them again for the last time, but before he had finished what he was saying, one of the guys jumped in the ditch and hit him with a club on his shoulder. He fell forward, and that’s when everyone suddenly jumped into the ditch and started hitting us, clubbing us, killing us. The image that really traumatized me for many years was seeing my mom’s head being chopped off. I was hit in the back of a head with a club. And I was unconscious.

I don’t know how long for, but when I woke up, everybody had died. I realised when I woke up that that they were burying us, bringing the soil down. And I thought, if I show them that I am alive they will see me and kill me so badly. So I waited, staying in that shallow grave for hours and hours, before screaming and praying and screaming and praying and not knowing if anyone was going to hear my voice.

Amazingly there was a lady who heard me, and she ran and got the guy that came and dug me out. As I came out I found out that my father also had just been killed because I heard the singing and the celebrating of the people that had just killed him. I guess he came down and offered himself to die because he had seen what had been done to his entire family. And so that’s how I survived and left my whole family in that ditch. I had just turned 14.

UN News Centre: Did you know the people that attacked you and your family?

Frida Umuhoza: We knew our attackers. Neighbours were killing neighbours. In fact most of the attackers that came that day to kill my family were on my dad’s soccer team in the area. My dad loved soccer and had started that group. So we knew the people that came to kill us very well. They were people we had been to school with and had over for parties.

UN News Centre: People often talk about the genocide as being something that happened very quickly, and it did. But the roots of it went back much further. When was the point when your family knew something bad was going to happen?

Frida Umuhoza: Genocide is not something that happens in a set way. It’s not something that if it’s thought about yesterday, it happens tomorrow. It’s something that is about propaganda and brainwashing and hatred being planted in people’s heads. I can remember when I was six-years-old, going to school, and discovering for the first time that there was actually a wrong tribe, a Tutsi tribe. I heard this not from my parents or my grandparents but the school. The Principal of the school would come in and ask how many Tutsis there were in the class. Even as a child you were taught that you are a “snake,” that you’re the wrong tribe. That’s how the children felt. Even the radio stations taught people that the Tutsi was the only enemy that they had, encouraging them and telling them about “the lists.” In school we heard of children telling us “Oh, you are in the list. We’ll kill you one day.” So we already knew things were not good in the country. But no one thought, not even my parents, that a genocide could occur that would take one million people in three months.

UN News Centre: Do you know what happened to your attackers?

Frida Umuhoza: Yes. I know that most of the attackers have been tried and are out now. I’ve been able to actually speak to the ones that came out of the jail, including the man who killed my father. I knew how everyone else had died but my father’s case was distant because I wasn’t with him. So I had to go and meet this man and to ask him all the details. Rwanda is a country where you actually meet those people that killed your family. You go to school with them. You go to market with them. You go to church with them.

What was it like to speak with the man that killed your father?

Frida Umuhoza: The very first time I met this man it was very emotional: anger, bitterness, fear. I couldn’t even shake hands with him for the first time. It took me years and years to be able to go back again after he was out of jail and ask him for those details. And, even then, you have a man who’s telling you “Yeah I killed him but I don’t know where he is.” They can’t give you exact details so that you can give them a decent burial. So it was very challenging. It was very hard. And I’m pretty sure all other survivors have similar issues because living with the same person that killed your family is not an easy thing to do.

UN News Centre: When you think about yourself as a young girl now, the 14-year-old that endured so much, what do you wish for her?

Frida Umuhoza: I wish that things had been different for me and my generation and for my family. What happened in Rwanda didn’t only take my family away from me, but it took all the important points of life as a teenager away. Growing up, no one wants to be called a “snake” or a “cockroach.” The genocide didn’t only take people. It took our dignity. It took away our rights to have parents and have guidance and have the happiness that a child deserves. I wish that the world that watched could have done something earlier, when killing was planted in the minds of the Hutus that carried the genocide out. Genocide is something that takes a long time. I wish the world had stopped it at the beginning.

UN News Centre: Around the world, in conflicts like Syria and Central African Republic, many children are still forced to live in terror and lose their families, just like you experienced. What’s your message to those children?

Frida Umuhoza: In times like that it’s not easy to find words to tell someone who is going through the same things that you have been through. But all I can say is that whatever happens, if you get a chance to get out, it’s like you’ve been given another chance or a second life. They will have to face a lot of traumas and issues. But my prayers go up to them and my heart goes out to them and I will say that once a survivor, always a survivor. Me and my fellow survivors in Rwanda have a lot of psychological issues- things like anxiety and depression, that we still have to face every day. But you have to wake up in the morning for yourself. You want to be a better person instead of a bitter person. I wish strength to other survivors of genocide. Stand firm and walk with your heads up- not knowing what tomorrow may bring, but knowing that having hope is a solution to everything.

UN News Centre: After the trauma you have been through, what is it that makes you able to cope and forgive?

Frida Umuhoza: The one particular thing that has helped me cope is prayer. I pray about everything. And I cry. But then I get up, wipe off my tears and tell myself I have to be better. Keep going. Feel hope for a future. Feel faith. I pick up my discouragement and turn it into strength. Being a hero is being able to give a smile to the person who has sold you death. And knowing that no matter what has happened to you and no matter what you’ve been through, your future isn’t going to be the same as your past. I don’t want my kids to live through discrimination. I don’t want my children to be called “snakes.” I don’t want my children to be called anything else but valuable children, and valuable human beings. So that keeps me going and gives me strength, knowing that we are raising another generation and that there’s another generation coming after them that will survive.

UN News Centre: Have you travelled back to the house you were in that day?

Frida Umuhoza: The first time I travelled there, in 1995, it was very disturbing. My house was still demolished at that time. It broke my heart, looking at my room and my brother’s rooms and this happy childhood home that I had. But in the end I was able to rebuild it. That was one of the signs that I wanted my children to see. That no matter how much one wants to break you can build yourself again. So I rebuilt my home. Exactly the way it was. I help a family who lives there now. I made sure that I put every animal we had as a child and put a family there. As I was building the house I was thinking about my brothers, my happy childhood, running around outside playing with them and thinking about how my father worked so hard to build that house. Thinking about my mom, how she had all kinds of people in that home. And knowing that we had parties in that house-parties that we will never have again, but still I wanted to feel the dignity and value that my father always gave our home. That’s what I wanted.

UN News Centre: What do you think is the one thing the world can learn from your story?

Frida Umuhoza: Every time genocide happens in the world we say “never again.” But it’s not a matter of just saying it; it’s a matter of doing it. And I believe that the international community has the power, has what it takes to stop genocide when it starts to boil up. When the world is watching, that’s the time to take action. Instead of waiting until a million people are gone, and saying “never again.”",https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/07/533682-feature-after-two-decades-genocide-survivor-opens-about-her-anger-and
Rwanda Border Patrol Shoot Dead 2 Burundian Refugees,"At least two Burundian refugees were shot and killed this past Saturday by Rwandan border control authorities while attempting to cross the border with Tanzania near Mahama camp.

United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement that preliminary information shared by the authorities mentions that the two refugees were killed trying to smuggle drugs into the country.

Rwanda National Police (RNP) said the incident occurred at 3:30am on Saturday.

“… security forces on patrol in Mahama Sector, Kirehe District, fired at a group of smugglers trafficking narcotics across the Akagera River,” said RNP.

“Two of the smugglers shot dead were later identified as refugees from the nearby Mahama Refugee Camp.”

UNHCR said it was “saddened by the loss of refugee lives and urges the authorities to investigate the circumstances of this tragic incident.”

“UNHCR stands by the side of the refugee community in Mahama camp and works closely with the camp managers and community leaders to maintain calm and provide the necessary psychosocial support while waiting for the results of the government investigation.”

The 2015 political crisis in Burundi sparked a refugee crisis in the region with thousands settling at Mahama camp in Rwanda.

Burundi has since urged the refugees to return home, saying the political situation has improved over the last few years.",https://chimpreports.com/rwanda-border-patrol-shoot-dead-2-burundian-refugees/
From ‘dead on the inside’ to ‘truly alive’: Survivor of genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda recounts her story as UN marks 25th anniversary,"“Most of the survivors we have today were broken in their bodies and their souls”, Esther Mujawayo-Keiner told those gathered in the General Assembly Hall, to reflect on what UN chief António Guterres referred to as “one of the darkest chapters in recent human history”, which overwhelmingly targeted Tutsi, but also moderate Hutu and others who opposed the genocide.

She recounted how the genocide took almost all of her immediate family, including her parents, most of her siblings and her husband. She thought she might be the last woman left standing, “because it was almost impossible to survive”.

But slowly, she discovered there were other widows - a new kind of family - adding that the “widows clan” helped her to be “truly alive” and no longer “dead on the inside”, and together with other female survivors, she founded the widows' association AVEGA.

Beware of ‘dangerous trends’

“Today we stand in solidarity with the people of Rwanda”, Secretary-General Guterres told the gathering, calling on everyone present to acknowledge “dangerous trends of rising xenophobia, racism and intolerance” at work throughout the world today.

Calling the current widespread proliferation of hate speech and incitement to violence “an affront to our values, which threatens “human rights, social stability and peace”, he saw them as the “dangerous trends” that were “clearly present in Rwanda immediately before the genocide”.

UN News/Elizabeth Scaffidi | UN Secretary-General António Guterres addresses the Commemoration of the International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda in the General Assembly Hall, April 2019.

“Today’s commemoration gives us an opportunity to once again raise our voices against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, including social and ethnic discrimination, anti-Muslim hatred and anti-Semitism”, the UN chief asserted. “Wherever they occur, these evils should be identified, confronted and stopped to prevent them leading, as they have in the past, to hate crimes and genocide”.

Mr. Guterres called on all political, religious and civil society leaders to

“reject hate speech and discrimination”, and to root out the causes that “undermine social cohesion and create conditions for hatred and intolerance”.

“Let us all pledge to work together to build a harmonious future for all people, everywhere” he said, calling it “the best way to honour those who lost their lives so tragically in Rwanda 25 years ago”.

‘Enshrine’ past lessons for future generation

“Tutsi were decimated”, General Assembly President María Fernanda Espinosa stated. Beginning on 7 April 1994, “those [who] opposed the genocide, including Hutus, were also targeted and killed”.

Putting the bloodshed into perspective, she said that “an average of over 8,000 people a day, more than 30 in the time allocated to this ceremony” were slaughtered.

“The international community watched in horror, but we did not prevent the atrocities”, lamented Ms. Espinosa, asking those gathered to “rekindle our efforts to realize our promise of ‘never again’” by investing in education “to enshrine the lessons” of the past, fight hate speech and “call out those who dehumanize others”.

Rising from the ashes

Keynote speaker Rwandan President Paul Kagame attested to his country’s fighting spirit, of how it went from darkness to hope, and called honour and prevention acts of remembrance.

“We honour the victims. We honour the courage of the survivors, and we honour the manner in which the Rwandans have come together to rebuild our nation” he asserted.

Citing “denial and trivialization” as the foundation of genocide, Mr. Kagame stressed that “countering denial is essential for breaking the cycle and preventing any recurrence”.

He pointed out that Rwanda has been among the top five UN peacekeeping contributors, explaining that his nation contributes soldiers and police, “with values instilled by our tragic history”.

“As a nation once betrayed by the international community, we are determined to do our part to working with others to make things better going forward”, President Kagame concluded.

For her part, Valentine Rugwabiza, Rwanda’s UN Ambassador, reflected on the time, 25 years ago, when “the world and the United Nations abandoned Rwanda”.

She viewed the event underway in “this very house that let Rwanda down”, as a historic one and expressed gratitude that although her country had experienced “interrupted” peace and security, it is now on the solid foundation “of social cohesion”.

No crime ‘like any other’

“I was asked to provide a photo of my family”, said survivor Marcel Uwineza, a Jesuit priest. “I actually don’t have any”.

He painted a picture of Hutus and Tutsis being pitted against each other, where “uncles turned against their nephews and nieces” and where his family “lost everything”.

Reverend Uwineza underscored that the genocide “was born of racist policy rather than war”, as many claim.

“We have to challenge the many deniers who use war as a means to minimize the gravity of the genocide, knowing that all lives matter, but a genocide is no crime like any other” he underlined.

Speaking about the “joy of reconciliation”, the priest described meeting the man who killed his two brothers and sister, saying that he had initially thought he was going to be murdered as well. But instead, the man knelt before him and asked for forgiveness.

“When finally I said ‘I forgive you’, I felt free”, Reverend Uwineza said.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/04/1036591
"For Rangers on the Front Lines of Anti-Poaching Wars, Daily Trauma","In May 2008 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 80 Mai Mai militia ambushed a unit of 12 wildlife rangers on patrol near Rwindi in Virunga National Park, wounding Habimana Buzara in the leg as he covered their retreat.

The rangers watched helplessly as the rebel group—aiming to terrorize the unit—tortured their injured comrade and kicked him in the head until he died. They buried their friend later that day, and the next morning they were back at work.

Wildlife rangers endure similar ordeals to soldiers in combat. They routinely face death, injury, or torture from poachers, and the wild animals they protect can kill them too. In the DRC, which has been riven by almost two decades of civil war and political instability, about 150 rangers have been killed in Virunga alone since 2004.

Rangers are exposed to deeply disturbing scenes, with each poached carcass a frustrating and grisly reminder of failure, and they operate in the bush under harsh physical conditions, often with inadequate equipment, pay, and support.

""Worldwide, about two rangers are killed every week,"" says Sean Willmore, president of the International Ranger Federation and founder of the Thin Green Line Foundation, a charity that trains rangers and supports the widows of those killed in the line of duty. ""But that's only partial data,"" he adds. ""It could be double that amount.""

Relentless Onslaught

In March 2013, poachers killed nearly 90 elephants in southwestern Chad, including 30 pregnant females, many of which aborted their calves when they were shot.

Since mid-April, poachers have slaughtered 68 elephants in Garamba National Park, in the DRC, hacking off tusks and removing the animals' brains and genitals. Nine elephants had bullet wounds to the top of their heads and backs, indicating they'd been shot with precision from helicopters.

In May in Mount Kenya National Park, Mountain Bull, a great tusker who was under constant monitoring and had had a portion of his tusks removed to deter poachers, was killed. And this month, beloved Satao, thought to be the largest of Kenya's elephants, with massive tusks that almost touched the ground, was found in Tsavo East National Park with his face mutilated and his tusks gone.

During the previous 18 months, Kenya Wildlife Service rangers and staff with the NGO Tsavo Trust had jointly monitored Satao's movements. But with ""mounting poaching pressures and anti-poaching resources stretched to the limit, it proved impossible to prevent the poachers getting through the net,"" according to the trust's published statement. On June 21, the Star newspaper reported that KWS rangers arrested three suspects in the killing.

Rangers on rhino battlegrounds face similar tragedies. In South Africa through June 5 of this year, poachers had killed 442 rhinos, 293 in Kruger National Park alone.

On February 28, 2014, tourists in the park came across a mutilated rhino wandering dazed, but alive, on the side of the road. Half its face had been hacked off with a panga, or machete, and its eyes had been gouged out.

Rangers then launched a search​, but dense bush and heavy rain made tracking difficult. It took them three days to locate the rhino, and when they did, they found that it had a bullet in its brain. They had no option but to put the animal out of its misery.

""It's a relentless onslaught,"" says Johan Jooste, special projects commander with South African National Parks (SANParks). ""This place gives new meaning to 24/7.""

Rangers Are Targets Too

Haltebaye Ndotoingar, assistant conservator at Chad's Zakouma National Park, says his worst day on the job was April 2, 2002, when he watched a man in his unit die during a battle with heavily armed poachers.

At dawn one day in September 2012, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Zakouma, poachers killed five guards (one other escaped but is presumed dead) in the wet season elephant range outside the park. The murders were likely payback for a raid on their camp a month earlier.

In April 2014, Virunga's head warden, Emmanuel de Merode, survived after being shot in a roadside ambush in what may have been an assassination attempt. He'd made many enemies as a result of his efforts to curb poaching in the park and to enforce a ban on charcoal production and stop oil exploration there.

Even successful operations can end traumatically for rangers.

After receiving a tip, rangers in Kruger pursued a poaching gang led by an ex-soldier. ""Shortly after getting into the area, we heard two muffled shots fired in quick succession,"" says Don English, the regional ranger for Marula South. The unit hiked toward the shots and froze when the undergrowth rustled. Just then four poachers burst out of the thicket, and the rangers dived for cover behind an anthill. After several intense exchanges of gunfire, they gave chase and apprehended two of the poachers. Two others escaped.

During questioning, the poachers admitted that they'd shot two rhinos. The rangers immediately mounted a helicopter search for the wounded animals, following tracks in the tall grass until they located an adult female in severe distress. Her calf and another young rhino were nearby.

As they hovered above her checking for bullet wounds, the rhino stumbled away and collapsed. ""With blood gushing out of her nostrils and mouth, in saddened silence we watched her die in front of us,"" English later wrote in his journal.

""It doesn't come naturally to any human being to put bodies into a body bag,"" SANParks Jooste says. ""Just to see the barbaric slaughter of those animals, it's not good for any of us. It's not good to see blood on the soil of good earth. It's not supposed to be.""

Rules of Engagement

Unlike soldiers in combat, rangers pursue criminals, not enemy combatants. Rangers enforce national laws and work under specified rules, and in South Africa and elsewhere, they're permitted to fire only in self-defense.

That need for restraint can be stressful, Jooste says. ""Here's this [ranger], tracking poachers in 45 degrees [Celsius, or 113 degrees Fahrenheit] for many days. He gets a sighting, but he cannot shoot at the person. He must now stalk the person."" Yet the thick bush hinders tracking. When the ranger finally finds his quarry, ""then he must challenge the poacher. Only when that person picks up his rifle may he defend himself. And that is taxing.""

According to Jooste, in 2013 SANParks rangers engaged in 65 firefights, but they recorded 108 sightings of poachers. ""Because we're law abiding, they get away. Because they run away into the bush, [the poachers] have the advantage.""

In addition, when a ranger in South Africa kills a poacher, the ensuing police investigation puts pressure on the ranger and his or her family—even if the case is dismissed. ""You're on the defensive all along,"" Jooste says. ""You know that when you sight them, in a split second you'll have to make a decision whether to defend yourself, and there will be consequences.""

Steadfast Commitment

""Many who become game rangers go into it knowing that the position goes with many dangers of wild animals, dehydration, irritating insects, never mind the poachers—and most are the type of tough personality that can handle the rigors of the job,"" says Kevin Bewick, head of the Anti-Poaching Intelligence Group of Southern Africa.

A recent ranger recruitment drive for Virunga yielded 1,800 applicants for 112 spots, despite the high death toll in the park during the past decade. For many, the attraction is the promise of a job, but that's not the only, or even the main, factor.

""Being a ranger was not a choice but a calling,"" says Stephen Midzi, whose base is Shangoni Post in Kruger. ""I was born for this, so had to fulfill what has already been written in my book of life.""

Zakouma's Ndotoingar says simply, ""I'm proud of my work.""

""Not a single guy has quit,"" SANParks' Jooste notes, adding that without the rangers like Midzi, poaching statistics would be a lot worse. ""Look what would happen if we weren't here.""

Psychological Challenges

Rangers deal with the stress of their work in many ways. Some use sport—running or soccer. Others simply accept it. ""I try to challenge myself,"" says Zakouma radio operator Hadj Tadio. ""I chose the business, and I knew that the worst awaits me.""

""I've seen exactly 409 dead elephants to date,"" says Richard Ruggiero, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Branch Chief for Asia and Africa, who regularly works on the front lines with rangers. ""My only recourse now is to try hard to stop thinking about how I feel. It's an indulgence that only leads to more heartbreak, anger, and frustration. So I just plunge forward.""

Others obtain solace from the place they love. Kruger's Midzi puts it this way: ""To sit among a pride of lions and hear them roar in synchrony, that's a moment that always renews my energy.""

Although no studies exist on how rangers in anti-poaching units are affected by repeated exposure to disturbing situations, the trauma suffered by soldiers in war zones may offer the closest proxy.

A 2010 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs guide warned families of ""combat stress"" among returning service members and listed their experiences, which are similar to those faced by rangers: Most U.S. troops serving in Iraq (in 2006) were attacked or ambushed (60 percent); received incoming fire (86 percent); were shot at (50 percent); discharged a weapon (36 percent); saw dead bodies or remains (63 percent); and knew someone seriously injured or killed (79 percent). It was noted that these types of ordeals can provoke a range of reactions, such as sleeplessness, agitation, anger, anxiety, and depression.

SANParks requires that whenever rangers engage directly with poachers, they see a psychologist. ""This is a guerilla warfare situation being fought by men and women trained to protect animals and not trained to kill,"" says Rethea Fincham, a clinical psychologist who treats rangers at Kruger.

She worries that when pushed too far, rangers could become a risk to themselves or others. Post-traumatic stress can provoke symptoms such as flashbacks, hypervigilance, or avoidance, which in turn could cause an elevated fright response. The danger: A ranger shoots unnecessarily, or hesitates to shoot when necessary, endangering himself or his colleagues.

Self-medication, too, with alcohol or cannabis can lead to potentially dangerous reactions on the job.

Community Support

On May 11 conservancy ranger Ltadamwa Lardagos of the Northern Rangelands Trust was killed on the slopes of Mount Kenya in a battle with a band of cattle raiders who had evaded law enforcement for days. Although the men escaped, villagers reported their movements to Lardagos's unit, and his team apprehended his killer later that day.

The trust's anti-poaching teams, with members nominated by their communities and representing each of the three ethnic groups in the area, patrol conservancies in northern Kenya to prevent livestock theft, which exacerbates ethnic tensions and is increasingly linked to ivory poaching. As a result of the patrols, the number of poached elephants in community conservancies decreased from 108 in 2012 to 45 in 2013.

On May 23, Zambia's Liuwa Plain National Park head ranger Dexter Chilunda was killed by poachers. People in the local community quickly stepped forward with crucial information that led to the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of both Chilundu's rifle and the shotgun used to murder him.

Community backing has even helped turn some poachers into conservationists. ""When I was a poacher, I was seen as somebody who was just a drunk,"" says Kenyan Sammy Manthi of Kidong'u Village, who now works as a community ranger with Tsavo Pride, an organization of former poachers that aims to create alternative livelihoods in villages around Tsavo West National Park. ""Now that I am a ranger, I am a respected member of my community.""

More Help Needed

""These men are really taking the strain,"" says psychologist Fincham. ""In order to keep them in this fight, more of the finances given for rhino poaching needs to go into the maintenance of the men at grassroots level.""

Many rangers lack proper training and equipment, even the most basic gear such as boots or first aid kits. And when something goes wrong—someone is injured, or worse—there's little support for the families.

Ranger work is so hard, the International Ranger Foundation's Willmore says, ""you'd think they might pull back, but they don't. It's unbelievable that they go out. Imagine the difference when we do the positive side. Imagine how much more effective they could be with support and equipment.""

Lardagos, 36, left behind a wife and two young children. Virunga's Buzara, 29, was the father of three, and Chilunda, the father of four.

Wives and husbands have to cope not only with losing a spouse or parent but also with losing their income and housing (which goes to replacements), and they often can't afford to send their children to school.

For the rangers themselves, knowing that if they get hurt, their families will suffer, lowers morale. ""When you start supporting widows and orphans, those still alive think people do care,"" says Willmore. ""It has a huge impact on the rangers and goes a long way to motivating them.""

So far, Willmore's Thin Green Line Foundation has given financial support to a hundred families, with a thousand more lined up for help. African Parks Network—an NGO that, in partnership with governments, runs seven national parks in six countries (Zambia, Malawi, DRC, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Chad)—provides a life insurance policy that pays widows the equivalent of three years' salary. In some cases, as with Lardagos's family, private donations are providing critical support.

Strong laws and meaningful prosecutions with harsh penalties (more than just a slap on the wrist) also send a message to rangers that their work counts.

In November 2011, two rangers spotted a Mozambican poaching gang in South Africa's Ndumo Game Reserve tracking a white rhino and ordered the men to lower their weapons. Instead, the men pointed their bolt-action rifles at the rangers, who fired, killing one poacher, Erasmo Mazivele. The rangers apprehended another, Wawito Mawala.

When the case came to court in June 2013, the outcome was stunning: Mawala was convicted of murdering his accomplice—even though it was the rangers who shot him. The magistrate stated that Mawala knowingly put his accomplice in that dangerous situation.

Make Targeting Kingpins a Priority

It's vital to root out corruption and arrest ringleaders at the top of the supply chain—otherwise, when poachers are caught, new ones simply replace them.

On its Facebook page in May, the Game Rangers Association of Africa noted that of the 96 rhino poaching arrests made in the first four months of 2014 in South Africa, all were low-level poachers, not kingpins or even mid-level operators.

In March, renowned conservationist and former Kenya Wildlife Service director Richard Leakey said that those behind the poaching in Kenya are protected by influential government officials, and he called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to take action.

Paula Kahumbu, CEO of WildlifeDirect, and Philip Murgor, former director of public prosecutions in Kenya, echoed those statements, noting the alleged involvement of an MP from Central Province, a governor from the Rift Valley, and two Mombasa businessmen.

Meanwhile, Kenya Television Network's Dennis Onsarigo reported that ""the country has only 11 kingpins behind the country's largest onslaught on rhinos and elephants"" and that they ""are known to authorities.""

""Put yourself in the shoes of an honest ranger,"" says Andrea Crosta, the founder of Elephant Action League and WildLeaks. ""Think about the increased motivation if law enforcement could bust those high up in the ivory supply chain.""

"1 million killed by machete, club and gun: Rwanda remembers its genocide 20 years later","KIGALI, Rwanda - Sorrowful wails and uncontrollable sobs resounded Monday as thousands of Rwandans packed the country's main sports stadium to mark the 20th anniversary of the beginning of a devastating 100-day genocide.

President Paul Kagame and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon together lit a flame at the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre, which estimates that 1,000,050 Rwandan perished in three months of machete and gunfire attacks mostly aimed at the country's minority Tutsi population by extremist Hutus.

""Twenty years ago today our country fell into deep ditches of darkness,"" said Rwanda's minister of foreign affairs, Louise Mushikiwabo. ""Twenty years later, today, we are a country united and a nation elevated.""

In the aftermath of the genocide, Rwandans felt alone, she said. But now friends around the world have joined ""to commemorate the rebirth of our nation,"" she said.

Representatives from France, however, were absent after a spat with Kagame that began with him accusing the country of participating in the execution of parts of the genocide violence. In an apparent jab at Paris, Mushikiwabo welcomed French citizens to Monday's stadium ceremony.

Ever since the massive killing spree, the world community has been forced to acknowledge that it stood by and did nothing. The U.N. chief told a news conference he hopes to reaffirm the international community's commitment to the idea of ""never again,"" though he said there are genocide symptoms elsewhere. Many experts say neighboring Central African Republic is at risk, Syria as well.

The-President Bill Clinton has said he regrets not doing more to prevent the slaughter in Rwanda and that ""it had an enduring impact on me.""

In a speech Clinton gave during a visit to Kigali in 1998, he said: ""The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy, as well. We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope.""

Many have blamed U.S. reluctance to act in Rwanda on the infamous ""Black Hawk Down"" incident in Somalia just a year earlier, which made the American public and therefore its politicians reluctant to involve itself in another African conflict.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, who attended Monday's ceremony, said the genocide was a ""devastating reminder that nightmares seemingly beyond imagination can in fact take place.""

As a survivor recounted his tale of violence, it triggered emotional reactions that required some mourners to be assisted by psychological counselors who were on standby. Bloodcurdling screams recalling the horror of seeing whole families slaughtered rang out from the crowd.

The violence Rwanda saw is nearly unimaginable. Hutu attackers burned down churches with hundreds or thousands of Tutsis inside. Machete-wielding attackers entered homes and slaughtered children and grandparents. Mr. Clinton, in his 1998 speech, said: ""Scholars of these sorts of events say that the killers, armed mostly with machetes and clubs, nonetheless did their work five times as fast as the mechanized gas chambers used by the Nazis.""

In Rwanda, a green and hilly and tranquil looking land, genocide survivor Immaculee Illibagiza told ""60 Minutes"" in a 2006 interview she saw something in the distance in 1994 and realized life would never be the same.

""I remember looking up to the hill across the river. And I saw somebody actually with a machete cutting somebody. And we were all like, 'Wow! Something's happening here. They're going to kill us,'"" she remembers. ""A person like when they're cutting, cutting. And somebody was screaming.""

People were screaming all over the country. The genocide had begun. It was extremely low tech - no gas chambers here - just machetes, spears and knives, wielded by Hutus, the majority tribe as they tried to wipe out the minority Tutsis.

Hundreds of mass graves were dug across the country to bury the victims of what the government says was a long-planned killing spree that ignited after the plane of then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down.

Now-President Kagame led a Tutsi military force from neighboring Uganda into Rwanda to end the mass murders.

Kagame has won praise for pulling his country out of the worst spasm of violence the world has seen in decades. His government has advanced women's rights, economic development and health care. But critics say that progress has been marred by the government's authoritarian grip on control that has seen many government critics and opposition members killed. Many Rwanda watchers have begun to call his 14-year reign a dictatorship.

Human Rights Watch, which Kigali practically views as an enemy organization, says civil and political rights in the country remain severely curtailed. It said the persistence of attacks on Rwandan government critics in exile ""is striking.""

As the anniversary approached, visitors began flooding the Kigali Genocide Memorial.

""After the genocide Rwanda was really a destroyed country, destroyed society. There was this feeling of being hopeless to people,"" said the memorial's manager Honore Gatera, mentioning all the orphans the genocide created, and all the citizens with physical and psychological wounds.

However, he argued: ""Rwandans got to know the dangers of humanity, meaning, in a positive way, now Rwanda knows how to educate ourselves, our children, our neighbors and our friends,"" he said.

Even as the three-month period of mourning began, a diplomatic spat between Rwanda and France escalated. Kagame in an interview with Jeune Afrique published Monday condemned France and Belgium for their actions surrounding the genocide, accusing both of having done too little to save lives. He also accused France of participating in the execution of parts of the genocide violence.

In response to the accusations, the Paris government said France's justice minister would not come to Kigali as planned. France's ambassador to Rwanda says he was then barred from the remembrance ceremonies.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/one-million-killed-by-machete-club-and-gun-rwanda-remembers-its-genocide-20-years-later/

Blood Papa: Rwanda’s New Generation

by Jean Hatzfeld (translated by Joshua David Jordan)

Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2018, 240 pp.



The French journalist Jean Hatzfeld is our great chronicler of sorrow. In a remarkable series of books, originally written in French and published over the past fifteen years, he has documented Rwanda’s genocide through the words of its Tutsi survivors and Hutu perpetrators—and, now, through those of their children. His books are essentially oral histories—though carefully constructed ones, interspersed with passages of his own texts—that both explore the specific, subjective experiences of Rwandans and raise broader ethical, philosophical, and political questions. Hatzfeld’s oeuvre is simultaneously furious and empathic, trenchant and gentle, revelatory and bewildered.

Writing for the leftist French daily Libération and other publications, Hatzfeld has traveled the world, covering Lebanon, Israel, Iraq, the rise of Poland’s Solidarity, and the Yugoslav wars. His Rwandan works are small-scale, and focus on one district, Nyamata; Hatzfeld revisits many of the same people from book to book. In the first volume, Life Laid Bare: The Survivors in Rwanda Speak (2000), the victims narrate their devastating experiences and attempt to understand them. This latter enterprise is, of course, a failure: genocide is a rupture of history—personal and political—not a continuation of it. As Sylvie Umubyeyi, then thirty-four, put it: “When I think about the genocide, in a moment of calm, I mull over where to put it properly away in life, but I find no place. I simply mean that it is no longer anything human.”

The second book, Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak (2003), is terrifying. A group of Hutu génocidaires from Nyamata, already convicted and imprisoned, calmly describe their crimes: the first time they killed someone, the murders of children (on whom they sometimes practiced), the rapes, tortures, and slaughters. What dawns on the reader—what emerges from these simple, forthright farmers—is a profoundly unwelcome reality: those three months of murder were the high point of these men’s lives, filled with excitement and camaraderie. Genocide, it seems, can be fun. A man named Élie Mizinge explains, “Basically, we didn’t give a hoot . . . as long as we knew the killing was continuing everywhere without a snag. Poor people seemed at ease, the rich seemed cheerful, the future promised us good times.” Machete Season ends with this admission by Alphonse Hitiyaremye: “At the end of the season in the marshes, we were so disappointed we had failed. We were disheartened by what we were going to lose. . . . But deep down, we were not tired of anything.”

Hatzfeld’s third volume is called The Antelope’s Strategy: Living in Rwanda After the Genocide (2007), and it is often grueling to read. The term “genocide”—like “crimes against humanity”—can be almost vaguely impersonal. The Antelope’s Strategy elucidates the ugly realities behind those words. Survivors—of whom there were very few—detail what they endured and how they survived in the marshes to which they fled: covered in lice and scabs, crawling through mud in tatters, stinking, starved, hunted, beaten, raped. They compare themselves to pigs and describe themselves as disgusting. “We were zeros in rags, walking target practice,” a woman named Médiatrice recalls. “In the forest, we behaved like crazy people. . . . It was a treacherous, almost animal existence.” The psychic toll is enormous: survivors describe themselves as stunned, lonely, bitter, broken; their trust in the world has shattered. (This was a major theme of the writer Jean Améry, who was tortured by the Gestapo and enslaved at Auschwitz; the Rwandans almost eerily echo his words.) Words like “reconciliation” and “forgiveness” seem like obscene jokes.

So does “the future.” Claudine Kayitesi explained, “I am an African and I am afraid of Africans. Happiness, for an African, it’s children first of all. . . . In Africa, children . . . are the last hope—but of what, we no longer know.”

Which brings us to Blood Papa.

Hatzfeld’s subjects, whom he refers to by their first names, always appear as distinct individuals. This is also true of the children—really, late teenagers and young adults—who appear in Blood Papa; each has his or her own way of grappling with their country’s poisonous legacy. Of course, there are commonalities: everyone learns about the genocide in school, and every April, the entire country participates in the “Week of Mourning.” Some of the interviewees were small children during the genocide; some were born in its aftermath; many have only hazy remembrances of it. Yet themes that unite each group—the descendants of Tutsi survivors and of Hutu perpetrators—do emerge. Details of what happened, and understandings of it, are shared within ethnic groups, not between them.

All of the young people who appear in Blood Papa are the offspring of those whom Hatzfeld interviewed in his previous books; it is fascinating to trace the intergenerational links. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the children of survivors want to know as much as possible; for children of the perpetrators, less is decidedly better. Tutsi parents are open about their experiences, at least when their children reach a certain age, and those children then search out more. “We spoke about the genocide in our family,” recalls Ange Uwase, the nineteen-year-old daughter of a survivor. “When I was thirteen, I had the courage to ask more probing questions. . . . I always craved more details about my fate because I myself escaped the machete as an infant.” She continues, “Our parents recount their experiences without beating about the bush. . . . [Papa] speaks in direct words of their filthy nakedness, of the children abandoned during their parents’ flight, of the ladies raped in front of people’s eyes. . . . There’s no end to my questions.” For Jean-Damascène Ndayambaje, sixteen, the opposite is true. “No, not a single question about the killings,” he says in reference to his father, Fulgence Bunani, who has received a life sentence for a particularly gruesome murder (discussed in more detail later in this essay). “No questions for my mama, either.”

There is no equivalent of Holocaust-denial among the Hutu children, just a type of willed ignorance—though this, too, can evoke torment, especially in a culture where respect for parental authority is paramount. Repression exacts a price in the form of gnawing doubts. “Would I insist that he give me details?” asks twenty-two-year-old Fabrice Tuyishimire of his father, Joseph-Désiré Bitero, who was the only man in Machete Season to receive a death sentence. (It has since been converted to life in prison.) He continues, “No, it might be repugnant to listen to. You get burned by touching certain wickedness. . . . Can a son blame his father to the point of turning his back on him forever? When a child stands before his father, he feels too intimidated to sort out the good qualities from the bad.”

The children of the survivors generally express pride rather than shame in their parents. The exception is, perhaps, those “born of a brutal seed,” that is, conceived in rape during the genocide. (The term “blood papa” has a double meaning: it can connote one’s biological father and, also, the monstrous lineage of murder and rape.) Nadine Umutesi, seventeen, was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a Hutu génocidaire had abducted her mother and made her his slave. (Her mother is Claudine Kayitesi.) How to absorb this perverse knowledge, which Nadine first learned from a malicious neighbor? “I feel trapped by a sense of something like disgust,” she admits, though she was raised by a loving man whom she considers her real father. Yet such an unnatural birth—such a grotesque pairing of intimacy and savagery—cannot be easily resolved. “I have seen far into the darkness of the genocide,” Nadine avers. “I sometimes think about the papa who gave me life by causing my mama such terrible suffering. I would still like to meet him. . . . Does a daughter forgive the man who gave her life? Would I try to understand him? . . . Maybe no words would come to my lips, only trembling.”

For many (though certainly not all) Jews, the Holocaust led to a questioning, if not an outright rejection, of the idea of God; how can one reconcile the God of the Israelites—or any other divinity—with Treblinka? In Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country—though one where some priests and nuns abetted the genocide, and where some of the worst massacres occurred in Catholic churches—the opposite seems to have occurred. A profound faith imbues the lives of the Tutsis and Hutus to whom Hatzfeld spoke. But though God may exist, He doesn’t answer the most perplexing questions—or even offer a sufficient balm. “My faith is deep,” says Immaculée Feza, sixteen, daughter of a survivor. “A people’s destruction is the will of God.” But wait: “Why would a benevolent God . . . accept the almost total extermination of the Tutsi population by their neighbors? That’s a good question. I don’t know the answer.”

The children of condemned prisoners pose such questions too. Idelphonse Habinshuti, nineteen, another son of Fulgence Bunani, defines himself as “a good Catholic,” but adds: “One still wonders, though, how a good and all-powerful God could shut His eyes to such killings.” Hatzfeld’s young subjects grapple in impressive ways with the centuries-old conundrum that human barbarism poses to divine faith; none use religion as a crutch. Says Fabiola Mukayishimire, nineteen, daughter of Joseph-Désiré Bitero, “God knew what was happening in the hills, but He provided human beings with the intelligence to choose between Good and Evil.” Why that intelligence failed is one of the many questions that haunts the children of the genocide; Blood Papa is, among other things, an exploration of theodicy.

Can a non-ethnic Rwanda be created? That, along with reconciliation, is the official policy of the current Rwandan government (the words “Hutu” and “Tutsi” are banned). All the young people in Hatzfeld’s book seem to recognize the policy’s necessity, and its value; all seem on board—at least on the surface. But ethnic identification runs deep, even if officially repressed. (One group of Tutsi girls, the daughters of survivors, meets secretly at school.) For Tutsis this is, in part, a way to respect the suffering of one’s forebears and to maintain the vigilance that such suffering has mandated. Nadine Umutesi explains, “My heart beats with the Tutsis. I stand with the people who have been ravaged by their memories.” It is a sentiment that Jews, Kurds, Armenians, and other persecuted peoples would recognize. But like all oral histories, Blood Papa is radically subjective, which means there is no criticism or analysis—indeed, no mention—of the Rwandan government’s own crimes against Hutus in, for instance, the Democratic Republic of Congo, or of President Paul Kagame’s repressive policies.

Innocent Rwililiza is a high school history teacher, a Tutsi survivor (first introduced to us in Life Laid Bare), and the father of the aforementioned Immaculée and Ange. He observes, “The first question that any new student asks reveals their ethnicity. . . . Their concerns are completely unalike. Students aren’t anxious in the same way; they don’t use the same words.” The children of survivors, he says, have conquered the guilt and shame of their parents; instead, “they hide a terrible desire for vengeance,” along with hate and rage. Immaculée seems to bear him out: “I despise the people who caused so much pain,” she says. “When I was a child, I hoped to see them lined up and shot. . . . But time has inspired more sensible thoughts in me; scolding had its effect. Children cannot avenge their parents if their parents aren’t considering it themselves.”

Hutu youths too, bury their fears and resentments, though Innocent says they “admit that their fathers’ crimes have made a mess of their lives.” Occasionally, ethnic identification is rejected; Fabiola Mukayishimire, nineteen, insists, “I call myself Rwandan, which is enough for me.” Yet unlike others interviewed in this book, who express pride in their country and continent, she yearns to leave Rwanda and its troubles—and, one suspects, her family’s shame—behind: “I would like to be living in Italy. I have heard that they live in peace and quiet, with no ethnicities or machetes. . . . Good cheer infuses everything Italian—that would be a delight.”

Intermarriage is very rare, and all the subjects agree that young Hutus and Tutsis never discuss the genocide with each other; despite the history learned in school, there is no common narrative. Ange Uwase says that resentment and distrust, not a search for the truth, unites the two groups. Yet, significantly, she insists that she does not fear the future: a major achievement in a country where, for generations, Tutsis lived in fear of recurring bouts of collective violence. “The farmers’ machetes no longer frighten anyone because people have gladly benefited from the policy of national reconciliation,” Ange says. But Sandra Isimbi, also the daughter of a survivor, expresses more ambivalence. “Those who steeped their hands in blood can no longer flaunt their strength in the same way. . . . The ex-prisoners cast nasty looks at us, as if they were still blaming the survivors for not being dead instead of blaming themselves for what they did. I don’t panic at the sight of machetes; nothing dangerous is in store. And yet I am afraid of those nasty looks in a way that I can’t explain. . . . Can they imagine what we lived through? I don’t think so.” It remains to be seen how official reconciliation and subjective feelings will be synthesized—not just among this generation, but among their children too. Rwanda’s future hangs on this.

In 2006, Jonathan Torgovnik, an Israeli photographer who moved to South Africa, traveled to Rwanda to interview women who had been raped during the genocide; he photographed them, along with their children conceived in violence, for a series called “Intended Consequences.” I saw these pictures in a New York gallery, and thought they were stunningly, if disturbingly, beautiful: the women stately and dignified, the children with sober, straightforward gazes, the backgrounds colorful and lush. Yet a deep and weary sorrow permeated these portraits.

The photographs were accompanied by testimonies from the women, many of whom were speaking of their ordeals for the first time. After reading a few of these narratives, I fled from the gallery (though I made myself return for a second visit). They are among the most appalling, and agonizing, testimonies I have ever read. Like Hatzfeld’s books, they make one confront the kind of unhinged sadism that Primo Levi, in the last book he wrote before committing suicide, called “useless violence.”

Many of the Rwandan women, who were often young teenagers at the time, were raped for weeks, passed, bleeding and beaten, from man to man; some had nails driven into their bodies, or sharp objects shoved into their vaginas. Some were forced to witness the murders of others or to drink the blood of their families. I will spare you other details of these women’s sufferings, but not the questions they, and Levi, raise.

War and violence are not inherently irrational, Levi rightly noted. “Is there such a thing as useful violence? Unfortunately, yes.” Wars, he argued, “are detestable, . . . but they cannot be called useless: they aim at a goal, although it may be wicked or perverse.” Useless violence, on the other hand, has no military or political use-value: it is a brutal tautology. Useless violence is an enclosed world, “an end in itself, with the sole purpose of inflicting pain.” Though it goes by another name, it is undeniably a form of torture.

Why, Levi wondered, were the residents of the Jewish Rest Home of Venice forced to endure the excruciating cattle car rides to a Polish death camp, instead of simply being killed in their beds? Why, in the camps, were inmates subjected to the forced nudity, the branding, the pointless so-called work before their inevitable deaths? Why the attempt to make the already-condemned suffer as much humiliation, and die in as much agony, as possible? In the Third Reich, Levi observed, “The best choice . . . was the one that entailed the greatest affliction . . . the greatest physical and moral suffering. The ‘enemy’ must not only die, he must die in torment.”

The same was true in Rwanda. And it is, I think, the baffling quality of this violence—standing, as Sylvie Umubyeyi said, outside of anything human—that haunts the children of survivors and perpetrators alike. (As Claudine Kayitesi told Hatzfeld in The Antelope’s Strategy, “To be betrayed by life . . . who can bear that?”) In Blood Papa, useless violence is epitomized by the actions of the aforementioned Fulgence Bunani, who, in Machete Season, made the perverse argument that the very enormity of his crimes was a kind of innoculation: “What we did goes beyond human imagination, so it is too difficult to judge us. . . . Therefore I think we must be farmers like before, this time with good thoughts.” Like many génocidaires, Fulgence benefited from a general amnesty in 2003. But seven years later, his luck suddenly changed: testimony at a gaçaça—a local village trial—sent him back to prison for life. His crime? As the victim’s young brother described it, Fulgence disemboweled Ernestine Kaneza, slicing her open “from her genitals to her chin.” Ernestine was pregnant at the time; her baby was then “scattered in pieces next to her.” (Ernestine’s sister was “taken away by the mob of killers . . . stripped naked, and macheted to the howls and jeers of a huge crowd.”) Of note: Fulgence and Ernestine were close neighbors.

Like the relatives of many Nazi killers, Fulgence’s wife and children struggle to deny the enormity—and uselessness—of this crime. “Do I believe Fulgence capable of the horrible crimes committed against Ernestine?” asks Jacqueline Mukamana, “The wife in me answers no. . . . If he had become a butcher like the others . . . I would have noticed that night in our bedroom.” His sons have questions too. Asks Jean-Damascène, “Do I know if my papa’s punishment is fair? I don’t enough of the details, except for what people say.” But, he admits, “My dreams fill me with panic at night. Terrible visions pass before my eyes.”

Is it possible to love a torturer—even, or especially, if he is your most intimate relation? Can the blood be disentangled from the papa? This is one of the terrible, probably unanswerable questions that older Hutus have bequeathed to their unfortunate sons and daughters. The comment of Jean-Pierre Habimana, the nineteen-year-old son of a former Hutu prisoner, seems irrefutable: “The genocide teaches us lessons that a young person would gladly do without.”

The past remains an open question for these young Rwandans. That is one of the most impressive things about them. They have avoided what Theodor Adorno called “mastering” the past: the arrogant assumption that catastrophic histories can be thoroughly understood, explained, rationalized, worked through, contextualized—in today’s parlance, theorized!—then neatly wrapped up and put away. The Rwandan youths to whom Hatzfeld spoke have recognized the falseness of this approach much more adeptly than did Adorno’s older and better-educated contemporaries. As Jean-Pierre Habimana, a Hutu, explains, “Today, we aren’t looking to forget, but I don’t know what we are looking for. The influence of the past isn’t going to fade away. Cutting down neighbors like animals is a big thing. . . . It is an unnatural history.” For the inheritors of the genocide, the past is not a foreign country; on the contrary, it is very much theirs.

Genocide—and the cruelties it entails—can stump even the most astutely analytical and historically informed writers. This does not mean that they—or we—should throw up our hands in helplessness or escape into mystical ideas about fate, national destinies, or innate evil. On the contrary: to understand is essential. But it’s also a perpetually incomplete, if not Sisyphean, task, which means we would do well to approach the histories we make with the deep sense of humility that characterizes Jean Hatzfeld’s work. Cutting down neighbors like animals is a big thing.

AIDS As A Weapon Of War: The Trauma Of The Rwandan Genocide — Human Rights Pulse,"The memory of the Rwandan genocide is still present and has marked the collective memory. The nation commemorates the dead but it ignores another a reality—the lives that still suffer from what happened to them during the genocide. It is estimated that 250,000 to 500,000 women were victims of rape during the genocide, which was part of the government’s strategy of ethnic extermination. These women still bear in memory the horrors of the genocide and some still bear it in their blood. Victims of rape, many Tutsi women were infected with HIV and still suffer because of it today. They survived the genocide but their fate is still tainted with a slow death because of the virus.

RAPE & AIDS: WEAPONS OF GENOCIDE

Rape was systematically used as a genocidal weapon against the Tutsis. During this period, sexual violence was not indiscriminate and disorderly but followed orders and was part of a bigger picture. Rape was not only tolerated but controlled and ordered by the Hutu power hierarchy. Next to the execution of men, the rape of women aimed to destroy the place of fertilisation and the inner space where a Tutsi life was to be born. Many women were disembowelled, mutilated, and killed shortly after being raped. Some survived the atrocities, but not without wounds.

The Rwandan genocide is the first time AIDS was intentionally used with rape as a weapon of genocide. According to survivors’ testimonies, HIV infection was deliberate and part of the strategy of the Hutu power movement to exterminate Tutsis by condemning Tutsi women to a slow death. Paul Kagame, former President of Rwanda, stated that “hundreds of AIDS patients were released from hospitals during the genocide and became an instrument of war, targeted at women”. As it was reckoned during the trial of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, one of the Hutu power leaders, the government went to find HIV-seropositive patients and encouraged them to perpetrate rape and transmit their disease.

POST-GENOCIDE: THE EMERGENCE OF THE AIDS ISSUE

Though the extent of rape during the genocide was known, including rape with the intention of infecting victims, it took years for the issue to be addressed. Few victims knew they had the disease. Testimonies of victims confirm that only a small number of rapists told the victims that by raping them, they were infecting them with HIV. Secondly, several years passed without women even suspecting they had HIV. Several women began to show signs of the disease between 1999 and 2002, which is consistent with the time for HIV to lead to AIDS, estimated between three and 10 years. To this must be added the immediate problems faced by women at the end of the genocide. Physical wounds and psychological trauma had to be treated, as well as providing food, shelter, and taking care of orphans. The extreme poverty many survivors faced did not allow women to ask themselves questions other than those related to everyday life and immediate survival.

It should be stressed that, at the time of the genocide and after it, Rwanda lacked the infrastructure for AIDS testing and treatment. In 1998, four years after the genocide, there was only one voluntary and free testing centre in Rwanda. Even if the screening was free of charge, further laboratory examinations were too expensive for the majority of the population. It was not until 1999 that the first estimates of HIV infection as a result of rape were made, in that case by the Association of the Widows of the Genocide—Aveva Agahozo. The study, conducted from three prefectures to assess the representativeness of women survivors, found that out of 491 cases of trauma and consequences related to rape, 66.7% were AIDS-related and the same number of women were HIV positive. After this study, the interest in HIV infection during the genocide has continued to grow from the early 2000s with publications from Save the Children, African Rights, and Amnesty International.

THE RIGHT TO REPARATIONS

Sexual violence plays an important part in the investigations of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). For the first time, rape was recognised as a means of perpetrating the crime of genocide. Article 21 of the Statute of the ICTR and article 34 of its Rules of Procedure enable the ICTR to provide victims and witnesses with assistance for their physical and psychological recovery. The Victims and Witnesses Section of the ICTR was given the management of $379,000 to provide assistance to the victims, which was shared between several organisations for women in Rwanda such as Profemmes, Haguruka, and Aveva Agahozo.

However, as innovative as it was and although a part of the money was devoted to medical assistance, the programme did not meet the basic needs for access to AIDS treatment. The sums received were too small and only allowed access to antibiotics. Thus, the AIDS issue remained unresolved. One of the main aspirations for justice should be its ability to adopt reparations and support victims. In the context of the Rwandan genocide, this means guaranteeing the right to AIDS treatment for victims of sexual violence. In this regard, the ICTR failed the victims of HIV infection.

Twenty-seven years after the genocide, it is hard to estimate how many women still survive after having been infected with HIV during the genocide. However, now the living conditions for seropositive patients and HIV treatment in Rwanda have increasingly improved and are more accessible for those who need them. The Rwandan effort to fight AIDS has benefited from the financial help of international institutions, especially UN agencies, international NGOs, and foundations. Between 2005 and 2012, Rwanda made great progress in the fight against AIDS. In 1997, 4.4% of the population was estimated to be seropositive. In 2005, it was 3% and in 2013 it went down to 2.7%. With the help of international organisations, it is now possible for a large part of the population and victims to access HIV treatment for free.

The exact number of rapes that were committed during the Rwandan genocide will probably never be known, nor will the exact number of women who were infected with HIV as result of sexual violence. However, these victims should not be forgotten. It is clear that the high AIDS rate among women after the genocide is linked to rape and other physical violence. As such, the justice system should have integrated AIDS as a consequence of those crimes and provided adequate support to the victims. However, after the genocide, few resources and little focus was given to the fight against AIDS. Many women could not do anything but slowly die of the disease.

It was only in the early 2000s, and thanks to associations such as Aveva and the financial support of international organisations, that the issue started to be addressed and victims provided with free treatment. Even so, one cannot forget the trauma and the use of AIDS as a genocidal weapon, condemning women to survive and die slowly. Respect for women’s rights to justice and reparation implies not only an end to impunity for crimes of sexual violence but also requires the taking into account longterm consequences of such violations and the implementation of measures to guarantee support for victims.",https://www.humanrightspulse.com/mastercontentblog/aids-as-a-weapon-of-war-the-trauma-of-the-rwandan-genocide
"A Face-Lift In Boston, A New Jaw In Rwanda: One Surgeon's Global Perspective","At Rwanda’s Kanombe Hospital in February, I removed a grapefruit-sized tumor from the jawbone of a 21-year-old man. Then, harvesting the non-weight-bearing fibula bone from the young man's leg, I used it to create a new jaw.

That day, after 12 hours of surgery on different patients, all with facial injuries, I received a text message from a Rwandan surgical resident about a patient at the local teaching hospital on the other side of the city of Kigali.

Agnes, a 14-year-old student, had been traveling to her first day of secondary school, catching a ride on a tractor trailer heading through the mountains of Rwanda. The truck lost its brakes and, in order to save her life, she jumped from the moving vehicle at a high speed. Sadly, everyone else in the vehicle died, and although Agnes survived, most of her face had peeled away from her skull. It had been a week since, and her injuries had yet to be treated properly. Agnes was now at the central university hospital in need of urgent attention due to an overwhelming infection.

That night, with a few instruments and by the light of a camping headlight, I worked with Rwandan residents to clear the infection and repair Agnes’ face. We picked Sorghum grains, which the truck was carrying, out of the deepest portions of her eye, and slowly, meticulously -- over the course of five hours -- we put her face back together with the suture we had.

Agnes returned to the operating room twice more over the next few months, and with time, she recovered. Had she not had surgery that night, she would have died.

One Facial Trauma Surgeon For The Whole Country

Rwanda is a country of 11 million people with just one Rwandan surgeon trained to perform facial trauma repair. This is woefully inadequate to address the burden of disease in Rwanda, and this picture is not uncommon for much of the developing world. Nearly one-third (between 28 and 32 percent) of the global burden of disease is surgical in nature. Surgery cannot continue to be neglected within the realm of global health.

At my home institution of Massachusetts Eye and Ear, I work as a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon, where we produce five new specialists every year through a residency program of Harvard Medical School. For nine months of the year, I run a primarily cosmetic and reconstructive practice at Mass. Eye and Ear, where the most common cosmetic procedures I perform include face lifts, eyelid surgery, nose jobs and facial reconstructive procedures on both adults and children.

For the other three months of the year, I operate and teach in Africa. This began seven years ago in Zimbabwe, where I was operating on children with cleft lips and palates, and where I met my wife, Jessica, who was a volunteer journalist. Now, with our two daughters, we relocate to Rwanda temporarily each year and I operate on patients and teach surgery to Rwandans.

Facial trauma repair includes fractures of the jaw, cheekbone, orbital bones, nose and forehead — and sometimes, it involves all of the above in what is called a “pan-face fracture.” Surgery involves exposing the bones through small, hidden incisions in the mouth, around the eye, hairline or natural skin creases, and then returning the bone fragments to their original position and fixating them in the correct position.

Hammers And Chisels

While the surgical principles remain the same in Rwanda, creativity is required as many tools are lacking. In Boston I use titanium plates and screws to fixate bones, but in Rwanda I often use simple wire, as was used in the United States 50 years ago. Electricity is not always reliable and we often operate with camping headlights, using hand drills or instruments for other parts of the body. It forces ingenuity — morphing universal surgical principles with “make-do” improvisation.

To replace small dental rubber bands we cut a tubed catheter. Drills are pieced together with new battery sources from other instruments. Bones that have healed in an incorrect position are re-fractured with hammers and chisels instead of electric saws.

Facial trauma is one such problem that, if repaired in a timely fashion, can reintegrate someone back into his or her daily life in a short time. Without treatment, however, people can be left with lifelong disability, deformity or even death.

Souzana is an example. She's a 74-year-old woman who, after a fracture of her forehead bone went unrepaired one year ago, arrived at my Rwandan clinic with a golf ball-sized infection that had eaten through her forehead bone and was on the way to the brain. An extensive surgery cleared the infection, but this could have been prevented at the time.",https://www.wbur.org/news/2016/07/06/rwanda-facial-trauma-surgery
"Félicien Kabuga, Africa’s most wanted man, is arrested","T HE TRAP had been set. American and Kenyan investigators were in position outside a house in a smart Nairobi suburb. But Rwanda’s most notorious fugitive never showed up. When police finally burst in two days later they found not their target, Félicien Kabuga, but blood-spattered walls and the partially acid-dissolved corpse of William Munuhe, an FBI informant. An enterprising hack, Munuhe had promised to lure Mr Kabuga to his house under the pretext of discussing a business deal in exchange for the $5m reward promised by the State Department.

That was in 2003. For 17 years, Mr Kabuga, seen as a bankroller of the genocide in which perhaps 500,000 Rwandans were murdered in 1994, remained elusive. On May 16th police raided a flat on the northern outskirts of Paris. Inside they found a shuffling 84-year-old who had outwitted police forces all over the world for almost 25 years. “He was our Klaus Barbie, our Eichmann,” Reuters quoted Etienne Nsanzimana, the head of a group for genocide survivors living in France, as saying.

Mr Kabuga, once one of Rwanda’s richest men, faces three main accusations. First, in the months before the genocide, his company allegedly imported hundreds of thousands of machetes, the weapon of choice during Rwanda’s 100 days of slaughter. These were then doled out to the Interahamwe, the Hutu militia responsible for much of the killing. Second, Mr Kabuga is accused of having financed the Interahamwe, supplying uniforms and vehicles. Finally, he allegedly provided the genocide’s soundtrack. Radio Mille Collines, the station he partly owned, referred to Rwanda’s Tutsi minority as “cockroaches” and urged their neighbours to kill them all.

Most people had given up the idea of ever catching Mr Kabuga. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which indicted 93 genocide suspects (including Mr Kabuga) and convicted 62 of them, wound up in 2015. But last year eight Western countries mounted a fresh mission to find him. Surveillance operations against Mr Kabuga’s 11 children in Britain, France and Belgium eventually led to his discovery in Asnières-sur-Seine.

Yet uncomfortable questions remain. How did Mr Kabuga escape detection for so long? Osama bin Laden skulked in caves and a nondescript house in Pakistan. Radovan Karadzic donned a beard and eked out a living selling quack medicine. But Africa’s most-wanted suspected génocidaire seems to have swanned around the world at will. At various times he lived in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya, as well as France, where the police say he had 28 aliases.

Some questions will be directed at Kenya. Much of Mr Kabuga’s time was spent there, almost certainly with the connivance of officials. Attempts to nab him in Nairobi in 1997, 2003 and 2008 came to naught. Instead, detectives would find a note on a kitchen table warning Mr Kabuga to get out—or find a corpse. In 2002 Pierre-Richard Prosper, America’s then special ambassador for war crimes, accused a Kenyan official of harbouring him, which the official denied.

Human-rights activists suggest that as recently as 2016 Mr Kabuga may have lived in the Kenyan town of Eldoret. By then, however, American investigators had given up trying to catch him, fearing that other informants could end up like Munuhe. Those trying to uncover who harboured Mr Kabuga will probably not get much help from Kenya, where the president and deputy president have both had run-ins with the International Criminal Court. ■",https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/05/21/felicien-kabuga-africas-most-wanted-man-is-arrested
United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,"Ferdinand Nahimana, founder and ideologist of The Radio Télévision des Mille Collines (RTLM), Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, high ranking board member of the Comité d’initiative of the RTLM and founding member of the Coalition for the Defence of Republic(CDR), and Hassan Ngeze, Chief editor of Kangura newspaper, were convicted today for genocide, incitement to genocide, conspiracy, and crimes against humanity, extermination and persecution. Ferdinand Nahimana, and Hassan Ngeze were sentenced to life imprisonment and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza was sentenced to 35 years imprisonment.

The judgement was delivered by former Trial Chamber I composed of Judges Navanethem Pillay, presiding, Erik Møse and Asoka de Zoysa Gunawardana. This case dubbed “the media case” examined the role of the radio station RTLM and the newspaper Kangura in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. It also reviewed the role of the CDR, a party found by the Chamber to have spearheaded the Hutu Power movement, which created a political framework for the genocide.

In a radio interview broadcast at the height of the genocide on 25 April 1994, Ferdinand Nahimana, talked of the “war of media, words, newspapers and radio stations”, which he described as a complement to bullets. In sentencing him, Judge Pillay, told Nahimana, “You were fully aware of the power of words, and you used the radio – the medium of communication with the widest public reach – to disseminate hatred and violence….Without a firearm, machete or any physical weapon, you caused the death of thousands of innocent civilians.” Called “Radio Machete” by some, RTLM told listeners on 4 June 1994 that the Tutsi would be exterminated. “Look at the person’s height and his physical appearance,” RTLM journalist Kantano Habimana said, “Just look at his small nose and then break it”.

Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, found to be the “number two” man in RTLM, was also convicted for his role in RTLM, as well as for individual acts of genocide and extermination, and his leadership role in the CDR. Tried in absentia, Barayagwiza refused to attend his trial after the Appeals Chamber reversed a decision ordering his release before trial for violation of his rights prior to his transfer to the Tribunal from Cameroon. The Chamber found that Barayagwiza, a lawyer by training, should also have been sentenced to life imprisonment, noting that although in his book he professed a commitment to international human rights standards, he had deviated from these standards and violated the most fundamental human right, the right to life. By order of the Appeal Chamber, the Trial Chamber granted Barayagwiza a reduction in sentence. He was sentenced to 35 years’ imprisonment for his role in RTLM and CDR, and for his role in distributing weapons that were used to kill Tutsi civilians in Gisenyi.

Hassan Ngeze, also a founding member of CDR, was convicted for his activities in ordering, instigating and aiding and abetting acts of genocide, as well as for writings in his publication Kangura. The cover of Kangura No. 26 answered the question “What weapons shall we use to conquer the Inyenzi once and for all?” with the depiction of a machete. By Inyenzi, Kangura meant the Tutsi, who were stereotyped in the newspaper as being wicked, having the inherent characteristics of liars, thieves and killers. The Chamber found in its judgement that Tutsi women, in particular, were targeted for persecution through the portrayal of the Tutsi woman as a femme fatale, and the message that Tutsi women were seductive agents of the enemy. The Ten Commandments of the Hutu, published by Kangura in December 1990, warned Hutu men of the dangers of Tutsi women and deemed as a traitor any Hutu man who married a Tutsi woman. In sentencing Hassan Ngeze to life imprisonment, Judge Pillay told him that while the Court accepted that he had rescued several Tutsi in 1994 in Rwanda: “Your power to save was more than matched by your power to kill. You poisoned the minds of your readers, and by words and deeds caused the death of thousands of innocent civilians.”

In the judgement delivered today, the Court affirmed: “The power of the media to create and destroy fundamental human values comes with great responsibility. Those who control such media are accountable for its consequences”.The Court also convicted Nahimana, Barayagwiza and Ngeze of conspiracy to commit genocide, finding that the three men used the institutions they controlled and coordinated their efforts towards the common goal: the destruction of the Tutsi population.

In its judgement, the Chamber recalled the important protections of international law on the right to freedom of expression and noted that some of the communications cited by the Prosecution were protected by this right, citing as an example, an interview of Barayagwiza broadcast on RTLM, which it described as “a moving personal account of his experience of discrimination as a Hutu”. The judgement held that it was “critical to distinguish between the discussion of ethnic consciousness and the promotion of ethnic hatred” and that the broadcast by Barayagwiza fell squarely within the scope of speech that is protected by the right to freedom of expression.

For the first time since the conviction of Julius Streicher at Nuremberg, this case addressed the role of the media in the context of international criminal justice. Streicher was executed after World War II for his anti-semitic publication Der Stürmer.

The trial opened on 23 October 2000 and ended on 22 August 2003 after 230 trial days. The Prosecution was led by Mr. Stephen Rapp and assisted by Ms. Simone Monasebin, Ms. Charity Kagwi, Mr. William Egbe and Mr. Alphonse Van. Jean-Marie Biju-Duval and Diana Ellis represented Nahimana, while Barayagwiza was represented by Mr. Giacomo Barletta-Caldarera, and Mr. John Floyd and René Martel represented Ngeze.",https://unictr.irmct.org/en/news/three-media-leaders-convicted-genocide

"Not Just Victims and Perpetrators: Understanding Rwanda’s Genocide, Twenty Years-On","Guest post by Aliza Luft

One day about twenty years ago, a Hutu soldier in Rwanda accepted twenty-five dollars not to kill a Tutsi girl who had been forced into a ditch. As Allison des Forges recounts in the monumental Leave None To Tell The Story, the girl, Marthe, had annoyed the soldier when she didn’t return his greeting from the pit where she was cowering. “I’m going to kill her,” the soldier proclaimed to his friend. But as he took aim, one of the militia, who knew Marthe, intervened. “You shouldn’t kill this girl. There’s no point in that,” he said, despite killing other Tutsi earlier that same day. He pushed the soldier away and gave him money to leave.

Twenty years after the Rwandan genocide, journalists and academics still work to understand how the country erupted into violence in only one hundred days. They rightly return to the question of how Hutu civilians managed to massacre 800,000 Tutsi, many their neighbors and friends. But fewer examine how some people survived. While many Hutu went on killing, a few found themselves able to resist. Such resistance was often necessary for Tutsi to survive the genocide.

Recent research on those 100 days of horror includes testimony by civilian killers in Rwanda. Embedded in those stories, I have found tales of risky defections — attempts by Hutu to evade participation and help Tutsi during the genocide, as opposed to killing them. In fact, like the example of Marthe above, often those who participated in the Rwandan genocide were also involved, at other points in time, in saving.

Consider the story of Olivier, recounted in Lee Ann Fujii’s book, Killing Neighbors: Webs of Violence in Rwanda. Described by Fujii as “every bit the willing executioner,” Olivier explains that it was impossible to save someone during the genocide because trying to do so would often come at the risk of death. Refusing to kill Tutsi meant being a traitor. And yet, Olivier saved his neighbor during the genocide despite massacring others. When he was alone one day, Olivier saw the neighbor — a little boy — trying desperately to escape the violence. Olivier pointed him in the direction of safety, pointing out which route to take so as to avoid getting caught by roving gangs of killers. When asked to explain his actions, Olivier says simply, “I ran into [the boy] when I was alone.” He adds later, “when you ran into someone when you were in a big group, it was hard to save someone.”

What does Olivier’s testimony and the story of Marthe, above, tell us about the Rwandan genocide, twenty years-on?

For one, it is easy to divide people into perpetrators and victims, but things are not usually so neat. We tend to think of genocides as black and white, or in the case of Rwanda, as Hutu vs. Tutsi. In reality, the truth is much more complicated. Many mediating factors, including access to money so as to “buy off” non-participation, proximity to other killers, one’s relationship with the possible victim, and sheer timing (was it earlier in the genocide, when fewer people knew what was happening in the capital where violence began, or later, as militia roved the country recruiting civilians to join in the war?), informed Hutu civilians’ decisions to kill or save Tutsi.

It is common to assume killers in a genocide are acting out of hate, or are monsters. Central to the way social scientists understand who participates in a genocide is the notion of dehumanization — the perception among killers that their victims are less than human. However, interviews often show how some Hutu civilians had nuanced perceptions of their victims, which led them to save some Tutsi, even as they continued killing others. We see this, too, in the accounts by Olivier and concerning Marthe. Despite being actively involved in the genocide, these killers saw some Tutsi whom they were willing to protect. As a result, it seems as if the process of dehumanization is actually an outcome of participation in killing rather than a precursor to it. Again, consider the following story, this time in an interview by Jean Hatzfeldt in his book, Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak.

Married to a Tutsi, Jean-Baptiste felt pressured to participate at the risk of having his wife killed if he refused. “Jean-Baptiste, if you want to save the life of your wife Spéciose Mukandahunga, you have to cut this man right now,” the others told him. Jean-Baptiste describes the scene of his first murder as crowded and hectic. Some men shoved him forward, others blocked him from running with their elbows. He struck a blow with his machete and immediately recoiled in horror. “When I saw the blood bubble up, I jumped back a step.” Later he describes adjusting to the process of killing. In his own words, “at first killing was obligatory; afterward we got used to it. We became naturally cruel. We no longer needed encouragement or fines to kill, or even order or advice.” Alphonse, another Hutu interviewed by Hatzfeld, explains similarly, “man can get used to killing, if he kills on and on. He can even become a beast without noticing it.” It wasn’t before the genocide that many Hutu saw their Tutsi neighbors as less than human. Like with Jean-Baptiste, many, in fact, were married to them. Only over time did Hutu stop perceiving their Tutsi neighbors as equals, stop perceiving their actions as murder.

Finally, many Hutu Rwandans did not willingly go to slaughter their neighbors. Many did not see the war as an opportunity to enact long-sought revenge. In fact, many of them were coerced by local authorities, or succumbed to peer pressure at the risk of being labeled a traitor. Political Scientist Ravi Bhavnani, in a 2006 study published in the Journal of Peace Research, refers to these killers as “reluctant perpetrators,” people who chose to kill because the cost of non-participation was too dangerous. Here, in-group pressures shaped Hutu’s actions toward their Tutsi neighbors moreso than any particular feeling of hatred. A final quote, in an interview by Scott Straus and Robert Lyons in their book, Intimate Enemy: Images and Voices of the Rwandan Genocide, shows just how tortured the decision to participate in genocide was for some:

My older brother had a Tutsi wife. She was there [at a church] with their children. When he went there, the head of the parish asked for food and beer. He went to get them at a center. But while he was at the center, the burgomaster came and said, “Where are you going with those things?” When my brother explained that the priest had asked for food for the refugees, the burgomaster found the killers and took them to kill my older brother. The group did this. But my brother was not dead; he was in agony. The priest came to see what had happened. The priest then went back to the church to get a car to bring my older brother to a health center. I went to see him there. When I arrived, the burgomaster said, “You, you have brought food for the Tutsis. So that you do not begin again, you take a machete and you have to decapitate your brother.” I refused. The burgomaster asked the reservist to force me to decapitate my brother and said if I refused the reservist would kill me. The reservist took me and gave me a machete. He put a gun behind my head and said, “If you do not cut, I will fire.” So I cut. That is my crime.

Paying attention to times at which Hutu tried to save Tutsi, or even negotiated to save some while participating in the murder of others, highlights just how awful genocide is. Before the start of genocide twenty years ago in Rwanda, many Hutu were living their lives separate from politics, side-by-side with their Tutsi neighbors. Knowing this does not mean we should forgive the behavior of Rwanda’s Hutu killers in 1994. But if we wish to prevent another genocide, or perhaps to better understand the ongoing crises in Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Syria, it helps to take into account that many of those caught in the violence are regular people, trapped in a horrible situation. To recognize this does not excuse the killers’ behaviors. But perhaps it makes them more understandable.

"Rwandan model Alexia Mupende may have been killed by domestic worker, police say","CNN —

A prominent Rwandan model found dead in her parent’s home may have been killed by a domestic worker, according to police.

Alexia Mupende, 35, was found dead with stab wounds on Tuesday at her family’s home in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital.

“It was around 7.30 p.m. local time, her body was found on the bed. The suspect is the family’s domestic help or house boy, his name is Niyireba Antione. Police are still looking for him,” police spokesman John Bosco Kabera said.

Kabera said the suspect fled the home that night, and his whereabouts remain unknown. Mupende was due to get married next month, according to local media reports.

Tributes have poured in for Mupende who was described as a warm and hardworking person. Hundreds of fans gathered outside her parents’ house to pay their respects.

Mupende had lived in Kenya and Uganda before moving back to her native Rwanda, where she studied business information and technology, the reports said.

In a poem paying tribute to the model, Hope Azeda, the founder of a local arts group with which Mupende had collaborated for years, described the her as “beautiful and eloquent,”",https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/10/africa/rwandan-model-stabbed-africa-intl

Congo refugees say Rwandan soldiers hurt them during food protest,"Around 2,000 people from the 17,000-strong Karongi camp in western Rwanda marched out of the camp to protest a 25 percent cut in food rations

By Clement Uwiringiyimana

KIGALI, Rwanda, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Congolese refugees in Rwanda said soldiers shot at them and wounded at least two people on Tuesday as the refugees tried to march out of their camp in protest at a cut in food rations.

A government minister denied the account.

Refugees said around 2,000 people from the 17,000-strong Karongi camp in western Rwanda marched out of the camp to protest a 25 percent cut that began last month in the rations provided by the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). The agency made the cuts saying it faced funding problems.

""When we reached the town of Karongi the soldiers stopped us ... one soldier in a car asked others to shoot,"" Eugene Mukabasoni, a mother of three, told Reuters by phone, adding that soldiers beat refugees severely.

""I was beaten over the head with a stick,"" she said. Several refugees gave similar accounts and one told Reuters he was shot in the foot. Rwanda houses some 174,000 refugees, including 57,000 who came from Burundi.

De Bonheur Jeanne d'Arc, the minister for disaster management and refugees affairs, disputed the refugees' account.

""We are still in consultations over what should be done but we think no refugee should try to return home (to Congo) in protest,"" she told Reuters by phone.

""Soldiers shot no one. The soldiers stopped them and refugees started hurling stones. So obviously when people start using stones as many as they were, some get injured. I don't have information that even at least shot in the air.""

Officials from UNHCR did not have an immediate comment. The agency and government are due to hold a news conference on Wednesday. Refugees would camp at a UNHCR office and not return to the camp, a refugee told Reuters.

"Suspected militants shoot at bus in southwestern Rwanda, kill 2","Two people were killed and six were injured when suspected militants opened fire on a bus in southwestern Rwanda, Rwandan police said.

Saturday’s attack, which killed the bus driver and a passenger, was carried out by the National Liberation Front (FLN), the armed wing of the anti-government Movement for Democratic Change (MRCD), the police said in a statement.

“Armed thugs, suspected to be remnants of FLN operating from across the border, shot at a public passenger bus,” the Rwanda National Police said late on Saturday.

The police were tracking down the assailants in the incident on the Nyambage-Rusizi road in the district’s Nyungwe Forest, they added.

The government has said the FLN had launched attacks from the Nyungwe forest area close to the Burundi border in 2018.

In April, the Rwandan government upheld a 25-year prison sentence for Paul Rusesabagina, who was portrayed in the movie “Hotel Rwanda” sheltering hundreds of people during the 1994 genocide, for his involvement with MRCD.

He was convicted in September on eight terrorism charges, which he denies. (Reuters/NAN)",https://www.sunnewsonline.com/suspected-militants-shoot-at-bus-in-southwestern-rwanda-kill-2/

"Recent decline in vegetative regeneration of bamboo (Yushania alpina), a key food plant for primates in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda","Our aim was to test for temporal trends in bamboo shoot availability in Volcanoes National Park (VNP), Rwanda over recent years. We show that, between 2013 and 2018, there was a decline in the number of bamboo shoots that emerged through vegetative regeneration. Although most of this decline occurred before 2015, current rates of bamboo shoot regeneration are at such low levels that even small future declines could eventually lead to a complete lack of bamboo shoot regeneration in our study plots. Moreover, we provide evidence that this decline in bamboo shoot availability is mirrored by a decline in the consumption of shoots by primates, and by an increase in proportional consumption. If proportional consumption increases further, then competition for bamboo shoots as a food resource might rise accordingly.

Trends in climatic conditions (e.g., VNP has seen a decline in rainfall and increase in temperatures, this paper), increases in primate population sizes which may have led to an increased intensity of herbivory, and natural succession of bamboo stands are all factors that possibly contribute to observed declines in bamboo shoot regeneration. Though it is difficult, for now, to separate causative from correlative relationships, we briefly discuss these potential causes of declines in shoot regeneration. Regarding climatic conditions, we note that Y. alpina generally grows in regions where annual rainfall is between 800 and 2,000 mm and mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 20 °C27,31,33. Although the current climate in VNP approaches such climatic conditions (minimum and maximum annual temperature 12–24 °C at lower elevations of the park and ca. 1,000 mm rain annually), we did find that rainfall during the growing seasons has declined in recent years, whereas temperatures have increased. Following these trends in climatic conditions, we could tentatively argue that abiotic conditions become increasingly less favourable at lower elevations, and more favourable at higher elevation, which could in turn explain the observed higher rates of regeneration at higher elevations. We propose that locally obtained microclimatic data (i.e., as measured within plots and across elevations) is incorporated in future explorations of the relationships between trends in climatic conditions and bamboo shoot regeneration. Climatic data with such ‘high spatial resolution’ will also allow us to explore possible effects of changes in rainfall seasonality and possible elevational range shifts for bamboo and associated biota34.

Effects of increased herbivory may also have contributed to observed temporal patterns of declines in bamboo shoot regeneration. For one, we found evidence of an increase in proportional consumption of bamboo shoots over recent years, as well as a relationship between the availability of bamboo shoots in a given growing season and consumption by herbivores, though possibly with an upper limit to the amount of bamboo shoots consumed at one particular location at a given time. This relationship confirms the importance of bamboo shoots as a food resource among primates in VNP but also leads to questions regarding possible effects of increases in competition for bamboo shoots, for example as a result of growing gorilla populations35. In this context, we also point to signals that high levels of herbivory may add to local declines in bamboo shoot regeneration in a subsequent season—which could reflect a form of resource depression also observed by Watts15—a topic for additional experimental studies.

Finally, we consider the role of natural processes in the bamboo life cycle and succession of bamboo stands. Interestingly, the growth rate of bamboo shoots increased over recent years. This is possibly due to altered rates of photosynthesis linked to climate change36, but may also indicate that bamboo stands have reached a ‘building phase’ in which we see an increase in the diameters and heights of subsequent generations of regenerated bamboo culms8. Nevertheless, given the fact that the complete reproductive cycle of Y. alpina (from seed germination and seedling recruitment after a mass flowering event to death of a bamboo stand) takes anywhere from 15 to 40 years to complete, we deem it likely that at least some of the bamboo stands in VNP have reached the mature phase8, when there is no further increase in bamboo size, with a lack of regeneration at some locations as a result.

With regards to spatial variation in bamboo shoot regeneration, we found relatively high rates of shoot regeneration in dense bamboo stands with large numbers of dead bamboo culms. High rates of shoot regeneration may result from altered understory conditions (e.g., sunlight reaching the forest floor10) or from compensatory regrowth after the death of bamboo culms and the availability of high densities of rhizomes from which new shoots might emerge. In addition, our finding that shoots regenerate more frequently at locations with a relatively low soil pH may, with caution, be linked to increased overall bamboo productivity on such soils37. Alternatively, the pH of soils in close vicinity to bamboo stands is known to decline as bamboo stands mature8, and relatively high rates of bamboo regeneration on more acidic soils can thus also potentially be linked differences in the age of bamboo in different stands—which may itself influence stand-level characteristics such as rhizome densities. More experimental approaches (e.g., changing soil characteristics within certain plots) may clarify the links between environmental correlates and spatial patterns in bamboo regeneration, as well as explore the possible effects of disturbances, such as soil trampling, bamboo harvesting, and fire11,25,26,27,29,38.

Regardless of the cause of the observed decline of bamboo regeneration, we may briefly address possible consequences of a potential lack of shoot availability for some of the animals that use it as a food or habitat resource. With regards to the mountain gorillas of VNP, we deem it probable that mountain gorillas can show some dietary flexibility20 if bamboo shoots become scarce, especially as it is clear that bamboo does not form a substantial part of the diet of all gorillas in VNP15. On the other hand, although there is no current direct evidence of food competition39, a decrease in bamboo shoot regeneration might become a problem if the population of mountain gorillas in VNP continues to increase. Besides, even if gorillas are not physically limited by a lack of bamboo shoot availability, there might be indirect consequences that are mediated through changes in behaviour. For example, the activity budget and energy expenditure of individual gorillas can change considerably as a result of the seasonal increase in bamboo shoot consumption40, and a lack of bamboo shoot availability can have unknown consequences for various gorilla behaviours, such as play and processes of weaning.

A lack of bamboo shoot availability might also not directly affect the nutrient uptake by individual golden guenons, as a large portion of their diet is made up of parts of mature bamboo (especially leaves) in addition to the occasional intake of other food items (fruits, flowers, leaves of other plants, insects)17,41. However, a lack of bamboo shoot regeneration is likely to impact golden guenon behaviour and population dynamics. For example, it may induce shifts in home-ranges or changes in reproductive patterns, especially as current birthing seasons seem linked to bamboo growing seasons17. Finally, we note that additional research will be needed to determine whether, and to what extent, a lack of bamboo availability leads to an increase in crop-raiding by primates.

Diminished vegetative regeneration, or even death of certain bamboo stands, does not have to be a worrisome development with only negative consequences, as it may be part of a natural succession cycle. For example, as bamboo mass-flowering and die-off events may increase the survivorship and growth of saplings of overstory tree species42, we could hypothesize that mass die-off of bamboo in VNP may have positive effects on the regeneration of the keystone tree Hagenia abyssinica43. Moreover, it is unlikely that bamboo will die-off instantaneously across VNP and both of the main consumers of bamboo (mountain gorillas and golden guenons) are likely to show some dietary flexibility. Moreover, although we found significant declines in bamboo regeneration in our study plots, it should be noted that 82 survey plots represent only a small portion of all the bamboo forest found in the Virunga Massif. Bamboo stands across the Virunga Massif, including VNP, show spatial variation in age, culm density and a host of other variables, and we consider it highly unlikely that bamboo regeneration will come to a simultaneous halt across the entire region. Nevertheless, we deem it important that conservation and research efforts focus on continuous monitoring of bamboo regeneration, in order to detect further changes. Specifically, there is a need for continuous monitoring of the responses of consumers of bamboo shoots to local decline/absences of this resource. Such research is urgent, as both mountain gorillas and golden guenons are endangered and occur in small populations in a relatively small and isolated geographic region, which could limit these primates’ opportunities to adapt to changes in food availability.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49519-w
Recovery After Genocide: Understanding the Dimensions of Recovery Capital Among Incarcerated Genocide Perpetrators in Rwanda,"Utilizing survey data from 302 men and women incarcerated in the Rwandan correctional system for the crime of genocide, and structured interviews with 75 prisoners, this mixed methods study draws on the concept of recovery capital to understand how individuals convicted of genocide navigate post-genocide healing. Genocide smashes physical and human capital and perverts social and cultural capital. Experiencing high levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms with more than two-thirds of the sample scoring above typical civilian cut-off levels, raised levels of depression, and high levels of anxiety, and failing physical health, the genocide perpetrators require multiple sources of recovery capital to foster internal resilience as they look forward to rebuilding their own lives.

Introduction

Post-genocide Rwanda has experienced a concerted, multi-dimensional program of unity and reconciliation aimed at bringing peace and prosperity to the country. Utilizing survey data from 302 men and women incarcerated in the Rwandan correctional system for the crime of genocide, and structured interviews with 75 prisoners, this mixed methods study draws on the concept of recovery capital to understand how individuals convicted of genocide experience and adapt to stress, distress, and trauma. Applying Maslow's hierarchy of needs to recovery capital, this paper explores the interconnections between social, cultural, physical and human capital and symptoms of posttraumatic stress after genocide. Maslow's hierarchy of needs provides an important framework for examining the “building blocks” of recovery capital that may contribute to successful post-genocide healing for perpetrators.

Literature Review

The Trauma of Genocide

State-sanctioned incitement to hate fueled the 1994 Rwandan genocide, where in just 100 days between 800,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were massacred with guns, machetes, and nail studded clubs (Reyntjens, 2004). It is estimated that up to one million individuals participated in horrific genocidal acts of killing and looting (Waldorf, 2006). Referred to as the most efficient genocide in modern times (Kuperman, 2004) owing to the speed and scale of the killing, and the “intimate genocide” (Staub and Pearlman, 2001) due to the close nature of the killing, the Rwandan genocide involved many, was swift and was particularly brutal. Atrocities included impaling male victims from anus to mouth, female breast oblation (Taylor, 1999), using HIV through rape as a biological weapon (Baines, 2003), and smashing babies against walls (Rutazibwa and Rutayisire, 2007). Scholars have noted that many genocide perpetrators were placed under “extreme pressure” (Schaal et al., 2012, p. 450) to commit genocidal atrocities. A confluence of pressures led to and sustained the genocide. Key precipitating factors included pervasive narratives of a Tutsi threat to the Rwandan social body (McDoom, 2012), pseudo-ethno categories promulgated by Belgian colonists under the guise of the Hamitic Hypothesis (Taylor, 1999; Eltringham, 2006), a frustration of basic human needs through poverty (Staub, 2003), and fear of personal violence if an individual refused to participate (Smeulers and Hoex, 2010).

The trauma engendered by the 1994 Rwandan genocide directly impacts victims, eyewitnesses, genocide perpetrators, and those immediately entering Rwanda post-genocide to engage in nation reconstruction. Therefore, we can understand the category of genocide “survivors” as comprising victims, eyewitnesses, perpetrators, and post-conflict reconstructors. Genocide perpetrators may experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress by witnessing their own actions, and the actions of other perpetrators (Schaal et al., 2012). Certainly, DSM-IV and 5 acknowledges that both being forced to commit violence and witnessing violent acts can generate posttraumatic stress (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

A small number of studies have examined the prevalence of traumatic stress among the Rwandan population post-genocide. (Fodor et al., 2015) examining 465 genocide survivors found raised PTSD scores a mean PCL-C score of 31.4 points (SD = 15.8, max. 79). (Rugema et al., 2015), drawing on a random population sample of 913 Rwandans estimated that 13.6% were suffering from PTSD. One study has previously examined levels of PTSD symptoms among Rwandan genocide perpetrators. Schaal et al. (2012) studying 269 genocide perpetrators found 13.5% met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Schaal et al. (2012) found that genocide perpetrators were continually reliving their genocidal actions and desperately seeking redemption. It is within this context that the current study aims to examine how key components of recovery capital—social capital, cultural capital, physical capital, and human capital—interact with and impact post-genocide healing.

The Concept of Recovery Capital

Emerging from the addictions field, the concept of recovery capital encompasses the sum of resources that may facilitate the lived experience of recovery (Granfield and Cloud, 1999, 2001; Cloud and Granfield, 2008; Laudet and White, 2008; Best and Laudet, 2010). Cloud and Granfield (2008) note that although substance misuse occurs within all levels of society it is differentially experienced, such that recovery from substance misuse varies widely. They observe that successful recovery depends upon environmental contexts, personal characteristics of the user, and the availability of particular resources. Cloud and Granfield conclude that recovery capital comprises four key components: social capital, cultural capital, physical capital, and human capital. Individuals who are “resource-rich” in each component have a greater likelihood of exiting from substance misusing situations. Furthermore, the various capitals are potentially convertible, for example social capital may be converted into human capital, and cultural capital may be converted into economic capital, although such conversions often take time and economic resources (Bourdieu, 1986).

Social Capital

Social capital “exist in the relations among persons” (Coleman, 1988, pp. S100-101). Drawing upon Granovetter's (1985) notion of “embeddedness,” Coleman emphasizes the importance of nurturing relational trust, having clarity around expectations, and thereby developing accepted shared norms. Such social capital may be conceptualized as horizontal ties and relationships among relatively homogenous groups, or vertical ties that connect levels between hierarchical levels (Baum and Ziersch, 2003).

Bonding social capital as a form of “social capitals” (Whitley and McKenzie, 2005, p. 73), is a function of collective actions between relatively homogenous groups (Putnam, 2000; Lo, 2010). Such dense ties are typically found in relationships between the individual and his or her family, religious institution, and immediate community (Coleman, 1988). Bonding social capital tends to be inward-looking, providing individual and group ontological security, often through the process of distancing others (Young, 1999). Bridging social capital functions between the individual and distant friends and associates (Lo, 2010), and community groups and movements (Putnam, 2000). Loose bridging ties may be formed through the generation of transitive trust (Fountain, 1998), whereby trust afforded to a closer tie is automatically extended to those with looser ties because of the strength of the original bonding social capital.

Vertical ties are a function of “linking social capital” (Szreter and Woolcock, 2004) which provides vertical connections between the individual and those with greater power (Granovetter, 1973). Such vertical ties, as Granovetter (1973) suggests, can lead to potential mobility opportunities, by providing access to power, wealth and social status to individuals and groups (Woolcock, 1998).

Critical to the development of bonds, bridges and links between individuals and groups is the development of mutual trust and solidarity. The development of shared norms promotes community solidarity in a cyclical trust-reinforcing process. Mutual trust lies at the heart of “collective efficacy” a group-level attribute defined as “a group's shared belief in its conjoint capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given levels of attainments” (Bandura, 1997, p. 477). Acknowledging the importance of collective efficacy—a community's perception that they are able to intervene for the common good—emphasizes the agentic aspects of social capital, and generates community “expectations for action” (Sampson, 2003, S. 59).

Scholars have noted that high levels of social capital speed individual and community recovery after natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes in the Caribbean region (Adger et al., 2005, the Asian financial crisis (Wetterberg, 2005), the Tsunami in Sri Lanka (Minamoto, 2010), and the Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan, China (Huang and Wong, 2013). Wider and denser social networks can facilitate recovery by expediting access to resources and guidance, engendering community mobilization, and raising the cost of community exit (Landau and Saul, 2004; Aldrich, 2011). In relation to Rwandan post-genocide recovery, the need to promote social capital has been recognized (Scholte and Ager, 2014; Verduin et al., 2014; Mahr and Campbell, 2016). The violence of mass conflict and genocide destroys social ties, extirpates mutual trust, and shatters social cohesion. Paradoxically, mass conflict and genocide has the potential to strengthen and concretize horizontal and vertical ties. Colletta and Cullen (2000) provide a nuanced understanding of the role of social capital both during and after the Rwandan genocide. For participating Hutu, Colletta and Cullen suggest, the genocide was “a powerful communal-building experience” (p. 41) where bonding ties were amplified. For Tutsi's and moderate-Hutu's bonding ties “founded on fear and survival” (p. 42) were similarly strengthened. Simultaneously, genocide destroys previously nurturing ties, through the loss of family members and neighbors, and the spread of uncertainty and mistrust (Zuckerman and Greenberg, 2004). Such a “perversion of social capital” (p. 40) renders post-genocide recovery a gargantuan task.

In post-genocide Rwanda, efforts to build social capital emanate largely from the National Unity Reconciliation Commission (NURC). Laws criminalizing ethnic divisionism and genocide revisionism (Thomson, 2011), and policies promoting “Rwandan-ness” (Vandeginste, 2014), seek to foster solidarity and trust among the Rwandan population. Although the nurturing of solidarity and trust is critical for the development of sustainable bridging ties, whether all Rwandans accept such forced unity and reconciliation remains moot (Thomson, 2011). Specific projects, such as the Association Modeste et Innocent, a non-profit organization that brings genocide perpetrators and survivors together through a process of intensive counseling and support (Dominus and Hugo, 2014) provide considerable opportunities to nurture bonding social capital between individuals, reinforcing notions of Rwandan-ness. Coupled with the acceptance of “unifying” laws and policies, and a strong individual desire for a peaceful future, there may be an iterative conversion of such social capitals to cultural capital.

Cultural Capital

Drawing on the work of Bourdieu (1973), cultural capital arises from and is shaped by historical, social, and economic processes as they impact families and communities (Weine et al., 2004). Cultural capital comprises of three distinct forms: the embodied state, the objectified state and the institutionalized state (Bourdieu, 1986). Capital, in the form of acceptance of and adherence to cultural norms becomes embodied when it becomes an integral part of the individual. Embodied capital is implicitly transmitted in family and institutional settings. The unconscious inheritance of cultural wealth is similar to Cohen's (1955) observation that middle class boys are advantaged in the school setting because they have already internalized middle class values. Cloud and Granfield (2008) suggest that the internalization of the norms of the dominant culture help the development of “stakes in conformity” (Toby, 1957), which can assist the substance misuse recovery process. Objectified cultural capital refers to objects such as paintings writings, and artifacts which may be appropriated through ownership or consumption. Thus, objectified cultural capital functions both materially and symbolically to endow the receiver with perceived cultural wealth. Finally, institutionalized cultural capital exists in form of qualifications and status endowed through institutional recognition. Bourdieu (1986) notes that such institutionalized cultural capital enriches the individual through its scarcity.

Just as there is a “perversion of social capital” (Colletta and Cullen, 2000, p. 40) during genocide, cultural capital becomes similarly exaggerated, contorted and misused. Embodied capital takes the form of hostility, resentment, and fear toward groups defined as “other.” Narratives of othering are often shaped by perceived and actual historical wrongs (Noor et al., 2008) that become integral to current individual and group identity. The other becomes perceived as a critical threat to the social body requiring classification, containment, and eventually extermination.

Perverted cultural capital becomes objectified through the generation and use of ethnic identification papers and identifying symbols such as yellow stars or blue-checked scarfs (Stanton, 2004, 2013). Physical characteristics such as slight differences in nose and lip shape or variations in skin tone are an inherited form of objectified cultural capital. Such physical markers of status, power, and difference cannot be shed. Markers of status become institutionalized through government policies that exclude and polarize. Specifically, Rwanda experienced a perversion of institutionalized cultural capital through the creation and distribution of lists of Tutsi and moderate Hutu's (African Rights, 1995), travel restrictions on Tutsi's (Kalimba, 2015), the creation and expansion of an all-Hutu government army (Stanton, 2004), the mass importation of weapons (Alusala, 2004), and the government-backed spread of genocide ideology through radio and newspaper propaganda. Certainly, the focus of mass torture and killing was on “ridding the polity of a categorical enemy” (Taylor, 1999, p. 140). Sustainable post-genocide recovery requires the reorganization and realignment of embodied, objectified, and institutionalized cultural capital, to engender peaceful and harmonious co-existence between previously fractured groups.

Efforts to build post-genocide cultural capital include the governmental promulgation of an historical narrative that pre-colonial Rwanda enjoyed unity and harmony (Gready, 2010), and assertions that, in relation to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, there is just “one truth” (Human Rights Watch, 2008). The “truth” of the Rwandan genocide includes three critical tenets. Firstly, the Belgian colonial administration were assisted by the Catholic Church to introduce divisive ethnic categories in Rwanda and so bear considerable responsibility for the subsequent genocidal crimes. Secondly, the genocide was organized by Hutu political leaders who misled the Hutu population to participate in the genocide. Finally, although there is some recognition that soldiers in the Rwandan Patriotic Army killed Hutu civilians during the genocide, these killings were unfortunate acts of war or revenge. Such “truth” seeks to concretize victim—perpetrator dichotomies, thereby strengthening embodied and objectified cultural capital. Overtime, there may be a conversion of this cultural capital into bonding social capital, although the unifying message is somewhat contradictory.

Physical Capital

The third key component of recovery capital is physical capital. Physical capital is “wholly tangible, being embodied in observable material form” (Coleman, 1990, p. 304). Related to the capacity to generate further wealth, physical capital is “non-human assets” (Qiang et al., 2004), and includes possession of components critical to the means of production such as plant, machines, buildings (Coleman, 1990), tools (Throsby, 1999), and equipment (Harkness, 1978). Viewing physical capital as a financial capital safety net, Cloud and Granfield (2008) suggest that it includes “income, savings, property, investments, and other tangible assets that can be converted to money” (p. 1973). They suggest that financial capital may help substance users' access help and resources, or provide temporary respite from environmental cues and triggers through leaves of absence or extended vacations.

Describing Rwanda immediately after the 1994 genocide (Gourevitch, 1995) writes that the country was “a virtually empty treasury” (para. 23), with factories and machines, power facilities sabotaged, and water systems polluted with corpses. Schools, hospitals, roads, and offices lay in ruins and genocidal looters had stolen all money from banks (Clark, 2018). The economic impact of such countrywide devastation reverberated for years after the genocide. Examining the economic impact of the Rwandan genocide 10 years later, Lopez and Wodon (2005) estimate that the genocide led to a 25–30% decrease in Rwanda's per capita GDP. Genocide and mass conflict seriously deplete physical capital impeding both short and long-term recovery. Physical capital, in the form of economic capital is perhaps the easiest form of capital to convert to other forms of capital. In post-genocide Rwanda the conversion of physical capital to human capital is an important feature of the reconstruction process. It facilitates the learning of “modern” farming techniques, engendering a livelihood offering more than subsistence farming. Such excess can then potentially be converted to strengthened physical capital. Although physical capital can be converted over time to individual social and cultural capital, such conversion may undermine unity and reconciliation efforts. Rwanda has the highest wealth inequality rate in East Africa, with the income of the richest 10% being 3.2% more than the poorest 40% (Asiimwe, 2017). Unless, however, income inequality and extreme poverty is addressed, economic capital is likely to reinforce divisions within Rwandan society.

Human Capital

The fourth, and perhaps most extensive, component of recovery capital is human capital. Cloud and Granfield (2008) suggest that human capital includes “knowledge, skills, educational credentials, health, mental health, and other acquired or inherited traits essential for optimal negotiation of daily life” (p. 1974). Becker (1994) suggests that education and training are the most important investments we make in human capital, observing that high school and college educational credentials significantly raise individual income. More recently, scholars have noted that although educational qualifications raise income, those engaged in career and technical education (CTE) programs have significantly higher earnings than those receiving credentials in non-vocational areas of study (Jacobson and Mokher, 2009; Dadgar and Weiss, 2012). Similarily, human capital theory (Becker and Tomes, 1986) posits that improvements in a parent or child's skills lead to the generation of new skills and abilities that can lead to intergenerational mobility.

Just as genocide destroys and perverts social and cultural capital, human capital is similarly ravaged. Examining the impact of the Rwandan genocide on educational outcomes, Akresh and de Walque (2008) found that there was an 18.3% drop in average educational attainment among children exposed to the genocide. Living through genocidal acts, whether as perpetrator, victim, or bystander, may lead to the development of mental health symptoms including anxiety, and depression and posttraumatic stress (Schaal et al., 2012). Scholars have also noted that experience of trauma may inhibit an individual's ability to develop future positive relationships with others (Ronel and Elisha, 2011).

Cloud and Granfield (2008) note that the three elements of human capital particularly pertinent to substance abuse recovery are heredity, mental health, and employability. They suggest that genetic mechanisms may influence physical and mental health and note the prevalence of co-occurring addictive and mental health disorders among the general population. Cloud and Granfield (ibid) also suggest that employment related skills are critical to addiction recovery as they can “provide a legitimate source of steady income” (p. 1974).

Bourdieu's (1986) criticism that human capital theory never frees itself from economism is pertinent and applicable here. For Cloud and Granfield (2008), human capital is an important component of recovery capital because it provides the means to develop economic and physical capital. Certainly, as Christie (2004) reminds us, production, monetary gain and consumption comprise the heart of modernity, and certainly are the drivers of human and physical capital.

Both physical and mental health are critical components of human capital essential to recovery from trauma. Subica et al. (2012) studied the relationship between trauma, depression, substance abuse, mental health, and physical health in those with severe mental illness. Their results indicate that trauma exposure and PTSD were associated with depression, substance use, as well as overall mental and physical health. Levine (1997) suggests that our ability to respond appropriately when faced with danger depends upon a number of factors, including the degree and intensity of the traumatic event, support from family and friends, age, physical health and fitness, experience of ongoing stress and fatigue, genetic resilience, learned responses to trauma, and self-efficacy in relation to trauma. Physical health status is particularly important. The residual energy generated by fight, flight, or freeze responses to traumatic events can cause a myriad of physical and mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, behavioral problems, and short and long term somatic symptoms. Traumatic stress symptoms arise from a post-trauma “tornado of energy” (Levine, 1997, p. 20) that becomes locked inside the body and mind. Such undigested trauma is stored as physiological reactivity (Scaer, 2005), often manifesting itself as loose bowels, stomach upsets, headaches and migraines, fatigue, hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease (Leitch et al., 2009).

The four key components of recovery capital: social capital, cultural capital, physical capital, and human capital discussed above, appear relevant and appropriate for considering healing and recovery from the trauma of genocide. A somewhat complementary framework for thinking about post-genocide recovery is Maslow's hierarchy of human need (Maslow, 1943, 1954). Specifically considering the Rwandan genocide Uwamaliya and Smith (2017) note the relevance of Maslow's hierarchy in thinking about recovery for genocide survivors. After genocide and mass conflict there are multiple physiological/basic needs which need to be met, such as water, sanitation, food, and shelter during post-genocide recovery. Their study further notes the difficulty in achieving access to clean water, where the goal of the Rwandan Government is to enable such access to all people by 2020. Addressing these factors in addition to higher level needs, is important for perpetrators as they are released back into the same communities as survivors.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which outlines specific needs that are considered necessary for individuals' to achieve a fulfilling and happy life, is one of the most prominent theories behind human behavior. Maslow's original scheme depicted five hierarchical levels, as the lower level is satisfied; a higher level of need emerges. The bottom five levels, presented in Table 1, indicate the original hierarchy of needs, in order of need, with the bottom (physiological/basic needs) needing to be met before one could move to desire and “need” the next level (safety needs). There has been broad support found for Maslow's theory and research into a hierarchy of human needs (Chulef et al., 2001). The highest level, self-transcendence, was noted by Maslow later, as a step where the individual may desire to identify with something greater than oneself. Maslow's model is a linear hierarchy that implies that one need must be met before the next need can be addressed. However, it is also possible to conceptualize needs in a more holistic way in which key categories of need interact and add to or deplete each other. Such an approach avoids overly-simplistic linear cause and effect intellections and instead acknowledges the fluidity and reflexivity of recovery and resilience.

TABLE 1

Table 1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

Given the relative youth of the concept of recovery capital, it is useful to consider it in relation to the more establish hierarchy of need. The concept of recovery capital can be viewed utilizing Maslow's broad categories of needs, regardless of whether one subscribes to the conceptual model of a linear hierarchy. Dimensions of human capital and physical capital correspond with physiological and safety needs. Social and cultural capital straddle social belonging and esteem needs. The educational attainment component of human capital also seems to correspond with esteem needs when educational qualifications afford individuals status and respect.

Studies have examined the validity and practical use of Maslow's theory within different cultural contexts. Gambrel and Cianci (2003) viewed, through a management lens, the application of Maslow's hierarchy within a collectivistic culture. The authors found that although the needs would be similar, the hierarchical order of the needs may differ. When looking specifically at China, they found that a sense of social belonging would be the most basic need, arguing that becoming accepted into society is the only way to satisfy physiological / basic survival need as well as safety needs. Potentially, this is indicative of the lack of a linear hierarchy, and suggestive that Maslow's identified needs should be considered in a less hierarchical and more holistic light, where reflexive interactions can shift the salience and interaction of the core components. Additionally, Gambrel and Cianci (2003) note that collectivist cultures do not possess “esteem” need, as individualism is not a need within the collectivist culture.

Additionally, a longitudinal study of quality of life factors across nations tested Maslow's hierarchy of needs on a national (rather than individual) scale. Hagerty (1999) noted that although not all parts of the theory were confirmed, the sequence in which the needs were filled, in a national sense, was correlated with Maslow's hierarchical model, although working to fulfill one area did not negatively affect growth in a different area (as Maslow would have predicted). Further, Tay and Diener (2011) conducted a study regarding the needs which would be associated with subjective well-being in multiple regions of the world. The study found that specifically in African countries (along with many other regions), meeting of basic needs predicted positive life evaluations. The results also note that, as predicted by Maslow's hierarchy, people desire to meet basic physiological and safety needs before other needs. Additionally, within an African context, Jonas (2016) found that fulfillment of the physiological/basic need was rewarding for a majority of respondents. Although other studies have contradicted the hierarchical nature of Maslow's model and the assumption that one need must be fulfilled to meet a higher-level need, studies acknowledge that the basic need categories could apply to some cross-cultural contexts (Tay and Diener, 2011; Hanif et al., 2013; Jonas, 2016). Maslow's hierarchy of need is an established and oft-adopted theory for considering human behavior and forms an important starting point for considering the recovery capitals necessary for successful post-genocide recovery and healing.

Materials and Methods

As the aim of this study is to examine how key components of recovery capital—social capital, cultural capital, physical capital, and human capital—influence the healing process of Rwandan society post-genocide, a mixed method was utilized. Specifically, we adopted a QUAN+qual simultaneous triangulation design (Morse, 1991) where surveys were collected and analyzed while supplemented with in-depth structured interviews. Thus, the results provide both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the above components of recovery capital. Below is a detailed description of the methods and measures used for this study.

Population and Sample

In order to achieve the above aim, the study identified men and women convicted of the crime of genocide in Rwanda. Accordingly, participants in this study are convicted and incarcerated genocide perpetrators. There are approximately 30,000 individuals currently incarcerated in Rwanda for the crime of genocide (Miller, 2016), in 13 prisons. At the time of the study there were 14 prisons. One of the study site prisons (Gasabo) has closed and the prisoners relocated. Individuals convicted of the crime of genocide are housed with non-genocide prisoners. Seeking to capture geographic diversity and representativeness in the sample, three (3) prisons were selected: Gasabo prison (Kigali City), Muhanga prison (Southern province), and Ngoma prison (Eastern province). These prisons were chosen because, according to Rwanda Correctional Services (RCS), they housed high numbers of genocide perpetrators. Gasabo prison (now closed) was a male only prison, Muhanga prison houses both male and female prisoners, and Ngoma houses female prisoners only. The researchers asked prison officials to identify incarcerated men and women who were sentenced for the crime of genocide. Such a request resulted in a detailed representative sampling frame of genocide perpetrators. From these a sample was drawn of sentenced genocide perpetrators for potential inclusion in the study. Although all study participants were convicted of the crime of genocide, no data was gathered concerning specific genocidal involvement. This was because of IRB restrictions, and to avoid potential activation and distress to both participants and data collectors. Prison officials confirmed that all study participants had killed during the genocide.

After the scope and purpose of the study was explained, prisoners who agreed to participate were asked to sign an informed consent form. The prisoners were informed that their participation in the study would not impact their treatment within the prison, nor the intended day of release. The form was written in Kinyarwanda (the official language of Rwanda). Overall, and to maintain balance between the facilities 302 individuals were sampled, with 102 perpetrators sampled from Gasabo prison, 99 perpetrators sampled from Muhanga prison, and 101 perpetrators sampled from Ngoma prison. Women were over-sampled because so little information exists on female perpetrators of genocide. Estimates of how many females participated in the genocide are difficult to pinpoint. Adler et al. (2007) note that 3.4% of people incarcerated for crimes perpetrated during the genocide were women, however these data were drawn from a pre-Gacaca sample. Examining Gacaca court records, Brown (2014) estimates that approximately 6% of people incarcerated after Gacaca were women, although acknowledges that without clear acquittal data this figure remains speculative.

Not all genocide perpetrators in the three selected prisons had an equal chance of being selected into the sample. The Rwandan Correctional Service generated lists of genocide perpetrators and individuals were grouped together and asked if they wanted to participate in the study. The researchers have no data concerning whether people initially refused to participate in the study. Certainly, genocide perpetrators too sick or considered too mentally ill to participate may have been excluded by the correctional officers. Others may have been on a work group outside of the prison during the research days, and so were also not able to participate in the study.

The study was conducted in Rwanda, in 2016, and data was collected over a period of 9 days. Before the commencement of data collection, a detailed study protocol was submitted and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the corresponding authors. The researchers also received written permission from the then Commissioner General of RCS, Major General Paul Rwarakabije. A team of Rwandan data collectors received orientation to the project, were trained in the data collection protocols, and helped gather the data from incarcerated genocide perpetrators. These data collectors were members of Rwanda Center for Council Foundation, an organization committed to restorative justice practices including council process, known as “peace circles” in Rwanda. The data collectors from Rwanda Center for Council Foundation were joined by staff from ARCT-Ruhuka (Association of Rwanda Trauma Counselors), who both served as data collectors, and were available to respond in the event of distress among participants during the data gathering process.

Data Collection

Three hundred and two perpetrators completed survey packs. It took approximately 30–40 min for participants to complete the survey pack. Survey packs included a basic demographic information form, the Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (Kellner, 1987), and the PTSD Checklist—Civilian Version (Weathers et al., 1991). Perpetrators who were able to read and write completed the survey packs themselves during the group process. Those who experienced literacy difficulties were assisted by a Kinyarwandan-speaking data collector. Approximately 20% of participants requested help completing forms. Although some participants advised the data collectors that they had learned to read and write during their prison sentence, the illiteracy levels of the prisoners were considerably lower than the estimated 34% illiteracy rate among Rwandans at the time of the genocide (Des Forges, 1999). Specifically, data was collected on wellbeing, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, anger and hostility, and posttraumatic stress symptoms, as well as on standard demographics. Each of the measures are described in detail below.

Demographic Information Form

Data collected through the demographic information form included gender, age, the district the perpetrator lived in prior to incarceration, the intended district of return, prior employment, and employment plans on release. Additionally, questions were asked concerning contact with family and friends during the prison sentence and support networks upon release. The family support data we collected are particularly relevant for examining the social capital component of recovery capital.

Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire

Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (Kellner, 1987) is a 92-item survey, examining both the presence or absence of symptoms and protective factors (well-being) experienced by participants in the previous 2 weeks. Items are answered in either “yes” or “no” format. The questionnaire measures the presence or absence of symptoms related to the following mental and physical health domains: depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, and somatic symptoms. Each domain is formed by 17 individual symptoms. For example, the domain anxiety comprises the following symptoms: nervous, tense/ tensed up, frightened, shaky, restless, afraid, scared, worried, terrified, takes a long time to fall asleep, jumpy, highly strung, cannot relax, panicky, frightening thoughts, feeling that something will happen, and wound up/tight. In scoring the Kellner Symptom Questionnaire one point is scored each time a participant responds “yes” or “true” to an item. The Kellner Symptom Questionnaire also examines aspects of wellbeing, specifically contentment, relaxation, friendliness, and somatic well-being. One point is scored each time a participant responds “no” or “false” to one of the items on the well-being subscale.

The Kellner Symptom Questionnaire was translated into Kinyarwanda by the data collection team and was validated for its accuracy separately by a minimum of three speakers fluent in both English and Kinyarwanda. The survey was then pilot-tested with a small sample of incarcerated genocide perpetrators in Gasabo prison in 2015. Adjustments were then made to the final version of the translated Kellner's symptom questionnaire.

Research indicates that the Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire has high reliability across the depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, and somatization domains (Teicher et al., 2015). The depression subscale is characterized by a Cronbach's Alpha = 0.94, anxiety = 0.92, anger-hostility = 0.91, and somatic symptoms = 0.86 (Kellner, 1987; Rafanelli et al., 2000; Thompson et al., 2004).

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C)

The civilian version Posttraumatic Stress Disorder checklist (PCL-C) (Weathers et al., 1991; Weathers, 2008) is a widely used, standard self-report measure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The items measured correspond with PTSD diagnostic criteria outlined in DSM-IV. The PCL-C measurement is a self-report rating scale—ranging from (1) “not at all” to (5) “Extremely.” Participants assess the degree to which they have been bothered by particular problems related to “past stressful experience” in the previous month. For Rwandan genocide perpetrators we adapted the PCL-C changing the words “a stressful experience from the past” with “the genocide,” where necessary. Statements rated therefore included “Suddenly acting or feeling as if the genocide were happening again (as if you were reliving it)” and “Avoiding activities or situations because they reminded you of the genocide.” The same translation process adopted for the Kellner Symptom Questionnaire was used to translate the PCL-C into Kinyarwandan. Previous studies found that the overall reliability of the PCL-C is very high (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.96) (Conybeare et al., 2012; Skeffington et al., 2016).

Levels of genocide-related posttraumatic stress, indicated by the PCL-C scores of participants, were used as a proxy for the concept “post-genocide healing” in this study. Schaal et al. (2012) suggest that perpetrators who continue to relive their genocidal actions and experiences more than 20 years after the genocide, through nightmares, flashbacks and thought preoccupation were more likely to desire peaceful coexistence with former enemies than those with lower levels of posttraumatic stress. Certainly, the PCL-C scores could be used as an independent variable in this study—forming a component of human capital—however, given that physical and mental health symptoms provided through the Kellner Symptom checklist were extremely thorough, we felt this element of physical and mental health was not lacking. Furthermore, the PTSD symptoms measured through the PCL-C differ from the physical and mental health symptoms measured thorough the Kellner in that they are symptoms directly related to the genocide. For example, the PCL-C examines the frequency of physical reactions (e.g., heart pounding, trouble breathing, or sweating) of the perpetrator when reminded of the genocide during the previous month, whereas the Kellner examines whether they have experienced “heart beating fast” or “breathing difficult” during the previous 2 weeks.

A choice was made to focus only on incarcerated genocide perpetrators, because of limited funding and access, and an expressed desire from Rwanda Correctional Services to better understand the needs of incarcerated perpetrators. Few studies have examined the experiences of incarcerated perpetrators, and in-relation to post-genocide healing such research seeks to develop understandings which transcend limiting victim-perpetrator dichotomies.

Qualitative Structured Interviews

As mentioned earlier, and in order to gain better insight into the experiences of those sentenced for their part in the genocide, 25 structured interviews were conducted in each prison—Muhanga, Ngoma, and Gasabo—totaling 75 interviews in all. Specifically, 50 males and 25 females participated in the in-depth structured interviews. At the time of the interview, they had served an average of 143/4 years in prison for their participation in the genocide. The interviewee sample was drawn randomly from the original sample of 302 génocidaires. The consent process was explained to each of the participants to be interviewed, and a new signed consent form was acquired for each in-depth structured interview participant. Participants were interviewed by two data collectors, with one asking questions from an interview protocol in Kinyarwanda, and the other, fluent in both Kinyarwanda and English recording responses in English. Each interview lasted approximately 30 min.

Overall questions examined readiness for release from prison, and as such focused on the various aspects of social capital, cultural capital, physical capital, and human capital as means to gain better understanding of recovery capital. More specifically, interviewees were asked to share the ways in which they manage feelings associated with their traumatic experiences as genocide perpetrators, and their perception of available support upon release. Examples for some open-ended questions that reflect the above are: Have you received any support or attended any programs during your time in prison? Imagine your day of release, what do you think you will do? How do you think those on the outside are going to react to your release? What are your biggest concerns about release? Tell me about your support network. Who will be there for you when you are released? Each question had subsequent prompts to help respondents focus on relevant information.

Constructing Recovery Capital and Post-genocide Healing

Both surveys and interviews affirmed the construct of key variables of recovery capital aimed to examine the relationship between social, cultural, physical, and human capital and post-genocide healing (see Table 2). Social capital is captured through the prison visitation questions in the demographic information form and interview questions relating to programs received in prison and networks of support for impending release. Cultural capital is explored through responses to interview questions concerning perceptions of how the genocide perpetrators will be received by the community when they are released from prison. The questions are a tentative step toward capturing the “values, beliefs, dispositions, perceptions, and appreciations” (Cloud and Granfield, 2008, p. 1974) of perpetrators of genocide as they draw on diminished stocks of cultural capital while they navigate community reentry. The variable human capital is drawn from responses to the Kellner Symptom Checklist, focusing on the physical and mental health symptoms and the protective factors of the prisoners. Physical capital is captured in interview responses to specific identified needs related to successful community reintegration. Finally, insight into our dependent variable is garnered from responses to the PCL-C checklist. Quantitative measures were chosen for social and human capital and qualitative measures were chosen for cultural and physical capital. This was because the components of cultural and physical capital were focused on perceptions of the post-release future rather than current experiences, and therefore were better captured through the interview method adopted.

TABLE 2

Table 2. Measuring components of recovery capital.

The quantitative data was entered into spreadsheets and analyzed using SPSS version 23 (SPSS, 2016). Specifically, binominal correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the relationship between components of social capital (prison visitation), human capital (physical and mental health symptoms) and levels of genocide-related posttraumatic stress. Linear regression models were then run to examine the relationship between social and human capital variables and posttraumatic stress. Interview responses were typed into an excel spreadsheet. The responses were line-by-line coded by the first author and two trained undergraduate students. The coders varied in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, and background experience. The initial level codes were then examined using the “constant comparison” method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967), to determine whether the codes assigned reflect the same concept. Effort was made to capture the originality within the data by ensuring that the codes were generated by the interview responses rather than the data being simply mined for themes compatible with a pre-existing theoretical lens (Rubin and Rubin, 2005).

Results

Descriptive Data

Of the 302 incarcerated genocide perpetrators sampled for this study 180 perpetrators were male (59.6%) and 122 were female (40.4%). More than half of our sample (54.6%) were between the ages of 45–59 years old, and just over one-third (33.7%) of the sample were older than 60. The age data indicates that the majority of perpetrators in the sample were between 23 and 40 years of age at the time of 1994 Rwanda genocide.

All of the genocide perpetrators in the sample were sentenced. Sentence lengths were calculated by asking what year the perpetrator entered the prison, and what year he or she will be released. Just under a quarter of the sample were unable to provide a potential release date. The overall mean sentence length in years for those who had a release date in the sample was M = 16.47 (SD = 4.56, range = 3–30). There were no statistically significant differences in length of sentence between males and females. The majority of perpetrators in the sample (87.4%) were farmers prior to their incarceration. Others were teachers, chefs, nurses, bakers, and bus attendants. The majority of perpetrators (83.1%) intended to become subsistence farmers when they leave prison.

Social Capital of Genocide Perpetrators

More than two-thirds of our sample of perpetrators (64.6%) reported receiving regular visits from family or friends during their sentence. Family visitation on Fridays is encouraged by the Rwanda Correctional Service, and facilitates prisoners' access to special diets and medicine. We asked perpetrators about their perception of the frequency of family and friend visits. Surprisingly, 55% of the sample felt that they had been “hardly visited” or “never been visited.” The apparent discrepancy between the reports of receiving “regular” visits and receiving few or no visits may be due to translation issues regarding the words “visit” and “contact.” Alternatively, it suggests a disconnect between a desire for connections with family and friends and the reality of prison visitation. The relationship between the degree of support while incarcerated and levels of current posttraumatic stress was not statistically significant.

Interviews regarding social supports indicated that the majority of perpetrators had some level of bonding social capital, naming spouses, children, or siblings as their primary support network when released. As one perpetrator describes: “My big family will help me to build myself. And I think they will help me reintegrate quickly in their daily life” (ID: 3006; male). Although the bonds were present, many perpetrators qualified the bond by recognizing the challenges their support network was experiencing. A husband was identified as one perpetrator's social support, “…but he is too old and sick” (ID: 2061; female), a wife was named as the central figure in one perpetrators' network “…but she is also infected with HIV” (ID: 1006; male), a child could help “…but he is poor also” (ID: 2077; female). Overwhelmingly, the efficacy of bonding social capital was challenged by family and friends being sick, poor, and/or old. Other perpetrators were unsure whether their family was willing to support them: “I have a big family, some are businessmen and I have one other brother in the military, but I am not 100% sure of their support.” (ID: 1084; male). Concerns about family members who had divided and sold their land or formed new relationships and had additional children during their period of incarceration, contributed to the uncertainty of pre-existing bonding social capital. Others acknowledged that they had no identified social supports and thus were relying on government officials to assist on their release. One perpetrator hopes for linking social capital: “The one to support me is the Rwandan government. I have nothing like any support or network.” (ID: 2054; female).

Given the uncertainty regarding bonds with family and friends, it is perhaps unsurprising that the majority of perpetrators cited the relationships they had formed with other prisoners as critical social capital they bring to the reentry process. One perpetrator describes the importance of maintaining relationships with his fellow prisoners: “I met different people here. Some became friends, we shared almost everything. So, I don't think when I am released, I will hate. I will stay connected with them.” (ID: 1089; male). The perpetrators spoke of other prisoners teaching them to read, write, and weave baskets during their incarceration. One prisoner acknowledges that the support he has received from other prisoners will help him when he is eventually released: “Other prisoners taught me how to read and write. They taught me how to behave on different challenges that may come as I go home.” (ID: 1015; male). The majority of prisoners had plans to continue visiting their friends in prison after they were released. As one perpetrator explains: “The other prisoners we pray together, we are friends, I will stay connected to them because they have become a part of who I am.” (ID: 1004; male).

Cultural Capital of Genocide Perpetrators

Examining responses to interview questions about how the community may respond to their release provides insight into the degree of cultural capital held by the genocide perpetrators in the sample. Many génocidaires aspired to work alongside fellow Rwandans to help rebuild their country, and develop themselves and their family. Some hoped to find family members whom they had lost contact with, while others aspired to join farming cooperatives. Most of those interviewed did not fear retaliation from community members, as they reported that their apology and requests for forgiveness had been accepted by the victim's families. As one genocide perpetrator states: “People from outside will have no negative reaction to me because I asked for forgiveness to all and now many of them visit me at prison. I don't have any worry regarding my release because I even wrote a letter to my family and all neighbors requesting to be forgiven.” (ID: 2007; female). For another, although forgiveness was already received, further demonstrations were considered necessary: “I don't think there is anything bad regarding people from outside because I asked to be forgiven and they forgave me. The people who made me imprisoned were my family because it was my brother that reported me. If I find my victim's wife has no child I can give her mine so that he can help her.” (ID: 2050; female). Other perpetrators were scared about not being welcomed back by neighbors because they had yet to connect with the victim's family, and ask for forgiveness. One perpetrator explains: “I used to live in peace with my neighbors, so I have no doubt that they will welcome me, what I am looking for is to go out and find the people I betrayed and ask for forgiveness” (ID: 2061; female).

Physical Capital of Genocide Perpetrators

The need for housing when released was one of the biggest concerns identified by the genocide perpetrators during interview. Former housing was destroyed either during the genocide, or fallen into disrepair in the ensuing decades. One perpetrator explains: “My house was destroyed. I will need to see how I can get another shelter” (ID: 3033; male). Another laments: “I need also shelter because my house was destroyed” (ID: 2100; female), while another perpetrator explains: “I am worried about poverty because everything was destructed, including my house and my animals were stolen” (ID: 2046; female). Money to help meet immediate physiological needs such as shelter and food were a big concern, as well as money to purchase land, animals, and tools. Some of the genocide perpetrators considered themselves fairly rich in physical capital, and therefore felt assured that their reintegration would be relatively smooth: “I have got a forest so it will help me a lot. My land is big enough once I do modern farming it will be very helpful” (ID: 2057; female). For a small number of perpetrators thinking about their future was overwhelming: “I am so much concerned about where I will start from, I came to prison when I was very young, my agemates have developed. It is as if my future was cut down. I have so many plans but I don't know where to start. I don't have [a] starting point” (ID: 3027; male).

Human Capital of Genocide Perpetrators

The Kellner Symptom Questionnaire provides considerable information concerning the mental and physical wellbeing of the genocide perpetrators. In relation to depression, 39.6% of the sample reported eight or more depressive symptoms and 10.2% of our perpetrators sample reported scores that are higher than 12. Depression scores ≥ 12 are considered clinically significant (Teicher et al., 2010). Approximately one-third of our sample (32.2%) had abnormally high anxiety scores. Overall the sample had extremely low scores in the anger-hostility domain, with the mean score being 1.57 out of a possible 17. The perpetrators raised levels of somatic symptoms. Just under two-thirds of the sample (62.8%) reported that their body had felt numb or tingling, and a little over a half (53.2%) had felt nauseated. Just under half had experienced cramps (42.9%), upset bowels, (36.0%) or were having difficulty breathing (38.4%).

The genocide perpetrators had elevated PTSD symptom scores, ranging from 16 to 79 out of a possible 85 (M = 40.51, SD = 12.86). Cut-off scores of 30–35 are suggested for civilian populations as indicators for PTSD. Typically, the prevalence of PTSD among the general population in the U.S. is <15%, with prevalence in Veterans Administration primary care and specialized medical clinics between 16 and 39% and in VA or civilian mental health clinics above 40% (National Center for PTSD, 2012). In our sample, more than 66.6% of genocide perpetrators scored above 35. Some 22.8% of the sample had a score higher than 50. Experience of PTSD symptoms was highly and significantly correlated with our measures of human capital (mental health and somatic symptoms). Increases in reported anxiety and depression symptoms were associated with increases in posttraumatic stress symptoms. Interestingly, lower somatic symptom scores were significantly associated with higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Perpetrators with fewer somatic symptoms experienced higher levels of posttraumatic stress. There was no statistically significant relationship between a perpetrators degree of social capital, measured by frequency of visitation, and level of posttraumatic stress symptoms.

Findings From the Linear Model Examining the Effects of Social and Human Capital on Healing

Using quantitative data acquired from the surveys, human capital was constructed by examining depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms experienced by the participants in the previous 2 weeks. These were drawn from answers to the Kellner Symptom Questionnaire, as discussed previously in this paper. Social capital was measured by the reported frequency of contacts from family and friends during incarceration, drawn from the demographic information form. Answers to the question: “How often have you had contact with a family member or friend while you have been in prison?” were originally measured using a four-point Likert-type scale, ranging from “Never,” “Hardly at all,” “Quite a bit,” and “A lot.” Given the spread of responses across the categories, responses were dichotomized into low social capital (those who responded “Never or hardly at all”) and high social capital (those who responded “Quite a bit or a lot”), to ensure better weighted categories. Our quantitative measurement for post-genocide healing was the level of posttraumatic stress symptoms experienced by the perpetrator in the previous month. This data was captured in the PCL-C questionnaire.

We examined correlations between our measures of human and social capital and PCL-C scores. Positive, strong and significant correlations were found between PCL-C scores and our key components of human capital: depression (R Pearson = 0.588, p ≤ 0.001), anxiety (R Pearson = 0.581, p ≤ 0.001), and somatic symptoms (R Pearson = 0.389, p ≤ 0.001). A non-significant negative correlation was found between PCL-C scores and our measure of social capital.

In order to examine the effects of human and social capital as our independent quantitative variables and posttraumatic stress symptoms, as the study dependent variable, two separate linear regression models were calculated. Specifically, linear regressions models were calculated for those with high levels of social capital (e.g., response of “Quite a bit or a lot” to the question on the frequency of visits while incarcerated), and low levels of social support (e.g., response of “Never or hardly at all” to the question on the frequency of contact while incarcerated). Both models were found to be statistically significant [r2 = 0.423, (adjusted r2 = 0.406), F (3, 107) = 26.110, p < 0.001, and r2 = 0.375, (adjusted r2 = 0.364), F (3, 143) = 28.577, p < 0.001 respectively]. Examining Table 3, the models demonstrate that the components of human and social capital are significantly related to healing after genocide, although the direction of the relationship varies with high and low social capital. Specifically, examining the model for high social capital reveals a better ability to explain the variation in the dependent variable (e.g., healing/ recovery) compared to the model for low social capital, as can be seen by the adjusted R2. A careful examination of the effects of the constructs of human capital reveal that depression and anxiety are both statistically significant factors that positively contribute to posttraumatic stress. Reducing depression and anxiety is likely to aid post-genocide healing and therefore the healing process. In other words, higher levels of human capital are positively connected to healing and recovery. While not statistically significant, the model provides a glimpse into the negative effect of physical illness on healing and recovery from trauma.

Discussion

The concept of recovery capital, comprising of social, cultural, human, and physical capital is a useful, nuanced construct for considering the conditions necessary for the peaceful reintegration of Rwandan genocide perpetrators after prison. The genocide engendered a perversion of social capital, whereby bonding social ties were strengthened through groups dedicated to killing, torturing, and looting. Inter-group bonds were strengthened by the dissemination of genocidal ideology and hatred. Simultaneously, bridging ties particularly with diverse groups were severed. In our sample the genocide perpetrators were relying on existing social ties to assist them with their impending community reintegration, however they were cognizant their involvement in the genocide and subsequent conviction and sentencing strained previously strong social ties. Unsurprisingly, given the length of sentence for many of the perpetrators, friendships nurtured in prison formed a significant proportion of perceived social capital on release. Such bonding social ties could be considered to be akin to traditional substance abuse recovery relationships, where those struggling with addiction form supportive relationships with those experiencing similar problems. Perpetrators identified a need for vertical linking ties with government officials to assist with their reintegration process. Certainly, efforts made by local cell and sector leaders to genocide perpetrators in prison is an important step toward expanding the social capital available to prisoners.

We have observed that just as there is a perversion of social capital during genocide, cultural capital is similarly perverted. Genocidal ideology based on fear and hatred of the other is transformed and concretized through the same mechanisms through which cultural capital is transmitted. The Rwandan government has made considerable efforts to facilitate a shared cultural narrative of unity and reconciliation since the genocide. The perpetrators in our sample described receiving anti-genocide ideology programming during their incarceration, including the “I am Rwandan” program, the “Unity and Reconciliation” program, patriotism programming, the conflict resolution classes. In addition, many perpetrators discussed listening to the national radio soap-opera “Musekewaya,” with its messaging of acceptance, inclusion and active bystandership against group violence. Such steps help to strengthen cultural capital to minimize the growth of genocidal ideology.

Genocide smashes physical capital, destroying basic infrastructure and depriving people of livelihoods. For many genocide perpetrators approaching release from prison there was considerable uncertainty concerning how they would achieve basic needs of food, shelter, and security. Those achieving some level of security spoke of wanting to build networks and ties, and live harmoniously with others.

For survivors of genocide, whether perpetrators or victims, human capital is significantly impacted. There was a high prevalence of mental health symptoms in our sample, with raised levels of anxiety and depression. Posttraumatic stress symptoms related to participation in the genocide were both widespread and severe. Unhealed psychological wounds may promulgate genocidal ideology and make unity and reconciliation unlikely (Staub, 2015). The high numbers of somatic symptoms experienced by the prisoners could certainly be the result of overcrowded prison conditions and limited nutrition and health care, however the common symptoms described including numbness and tingling, nausea, upset bowels, difficulty breathing and heavy arms and legs are symptoms often associated with stress, distress, and trauma. Indeed, it could be tentatively argued that our findings from the linear regression models support these findings as somatization was negatively related to high level of social support and thus perhaps negatively affecting the healing process. Although not statistically significant, perhaps owing to the small sample size, it is reasonable to consider that the gains achieved by social support on post-genocide recovery are negatively impacted by high levels of physical health problems.

It is clear that in relation to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the first three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and esteem are critical for the development of post-genocide recovery capital among genocide perpetrators. The incarcerated perpetrators require nurturing forms of social, human, and physical capital to successfully reintegrate into society after their prison sentences. Social ties, with both existing family members and bonds developed during their years of post-genocide incarceration were identified as a critical re-entry need. The higher levels of Maslow's hierarchy, self-actualization and self-transcendence, are threatened by genocide-influenced perversions in social and cultural capital. Whether such perversions can be neutralized in post-genocide Rwanda through a top-down unity and reconciliation narrative remains moot. Certainly, efforts to build individual social ties between perpetrators and survivors are important steps toward ensuring that all Rwandans can realize and fulfill their potential.

Although recovery capital is a useful concept for considering post-genocide trauma recovery, it may be more pertinent for future researchers to consider whether a resilience model rather than a recovery model best captures the interconnectivity of social, cultural, human, and physical capital after trauma. Through a recovery lens the components of recovery capital become stocks from which to draw. With enough investments the individual can heal, and to be healed is a return to the pre-trauma or pre-addiction state. The concept of resilience capital perhaps provides a richer, more dynamic, and certainly more generative appreciation of how individuals not only survive traumatic genocidal experiences, but also make positive meaning going forward.

There are several limitations to this study. First, although efforts were made to draw our sample from different geographic locations in Rwanda, sampling error may have occurred. Generation of a complete sampling frame of all genocide perpetrators was neither practical or feasible. Secondly, the measures used were developed and validated in western contexts. Although the authors involved Rwandan partners extensively in the translation (and hence initial interpretation), and validation of the instruments, groups of symptoms may not be experienced as specific constructs (anxiety, depression and so forth) within the Rwandan context. In particular, physical symptoms of posttraumatic stress may vary in different cultural contexts (Rasmussen et al., 2007). We did, however, ensure that the tools used were locally agreed upon and culturally calibrated. Another limitation is our use of levels of PTSD symptoms as a proxy for post-genocide healing. Posttraumatic stress levels could certainly have been used as an independent variable rather than the dependent variable in this study, as posttraumatic symptoms could be considered an element of human capital.

A considerable strength of the study is the mixed methods design involving the collection of survey data from 302 incarcerated genocide perpetrators in Rwanda, triangulated with in-depth structured interviews with 50 male and 25 female perpetrators. Together the data provide a nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by individuals as a country moves beyond genocidal ideology. Recovery after genocide requires the strengthening of social, cultural, physical, and human capital, a daunting endeavor when important social assets can be perverted or destroyed during the violence. Bringing the lens of recovery capital to our examination of post-genocide recovery can accentuate resiliency, highlight deficits and strengths in the recovery process, and identify critical areas where services are needed.

Attacks in Syria and Yemen are turning disease into a weapon of war,"Barely two decades ago, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia first treated rape and sexual assault as distinct war crimes. That decision revolutionized our understanding of rape as a weapon of war, leading in 1997 to the first-ever prosecution of rape as a war crime in Rwanda.

Today we are seeing another cruel method of warfare emerge on the battlefield: the weaponization of disease, particularly in Syria and Yemen.

Targeting health care facilities during conflict has occurred before. But unlike the attacks on hospital ships during World War I, or even sporadic attacks in more recent conflicts, the pace of attacks on health facilities, workers, and resources in Syria and Yemen is massive and unrelenting.

In the past three years, combatants in these conflicts have actively targeted health and humanitarian facilities and indiscriminately decimated civilian infrastructure. Hospitals are out of service. Clinics have been destroyed. Water treatment plants have been turned to rubble. Vaccines and other lifesaving drugs have been intentionally blocked from reaching civilians.

All of this has created public health catastrophes — a massive cholera outbreak in Yemen, and new outbreaks of once-vanquished diseases like polio and measles in Syria and Yemen. These put millions of children at risk for death and illness.

My organization, Physicians for Human Rights, has mapped the systematic attacks on hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities in Syria. Our data show that, since 2011, there have been a staggering 477 attacks on medical facilities, as well as the deaths of 820 medical personnel. Nine out of 10 of these attacks were launched by the Syrian government or its Russian allies. Each of these strikes puts essential medical care further out of reach for thousands of sick and injured Syrians.

None of the conflict’s belligerents have acknowledged that their actions are purposefully creating a public health disaster. In fact, after launching a lethal chemical weapons strike in April, the Syrian government then brazenly struck the hospital where survivors were being treated. There have been few, if any, substantive consequences for these blatant violations of international law.

Such attacks have dire consequences. For each doctor killed or clinic destroyed, an untold number of patients suffer. As hospitals, clinics, and water treatment and sanitation facilities have become targets, civilian survivors of bombs or bullets or poison gas have fallen victim to previously controlled infectious diseases.

Take, for example, the recent polio outbreak in eastern Syria. It started when an oral form of the live polio vaccine mutated. Abysmal sanitation helped it spread through the population. Children who hadn’t been vaccinated against polio contracted the crippling and potentially deadly virus. It’s a perfect epidemiological storm, enabled by warfare.

In Yemen, the targeting of hospitals, clinics, water treatment plants, and sanitation facilities has caused the largest cholera outbreak in the world, with 5,000 new infections every day. To date, more than 200,000 people have been infected, and 1,300 have died. All parties to the conflict share responsibility, as combatants on all sides — including the Saudi coalition using U.S.- and European-made arms — have attacked the country’s health infrastructure. Such targeting has also paved the way for a measles outbreak in Yemen.

Cholera and measles, both preventable and treatable diseases, prey on the vulnerable. With 1.5 million children facing malnutrition in Yemen, both of these diseases may ultimately claim an unconscionable number of young lives.

There are many signs of hope and humanity in both Syria and Yemen. Despite a lack of pay and protection, thousands of health workers are making incredible sacrifices to identify individuals who need medical help and provide whatever treatment is available. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders, and other international organizations are making headway in efforts to broaden vaccination and treatment.

We must not make the mistake of thinking of these deaths and illnesses as collateral damage of war. They are not accidental, and the destruction of medical and sanitation infrastructure is part of a cruel, illegal, and intentional strategy.

As the world acknowledged two decades ago in the Balkans and Rwanda, wars aren’t just waged on the battlefield with bombs and bullets. And even though modern warfare is insidious and battlefields are sometimes uncertain, the laws of warfare still apply.

That means there must be independent investigations of violations of international law when it comes to targeting health and humanitarian resources. There must also be regular and public reporting of incidents at the United Nations Human Rights Council and Security Council. We must recognize and prosecute these acts as war crimes, specifically as violations of the Geneva Convention.

Hundreds of thousands have already died in Syria and Yemen. And without accountability and clear condemnation from the international community, millions more lives are at stake.

Rwandan Hutu leader wanted by the Hague shot dead by DR Congo troops,"DR Congo - Rwanda

Lionel Healing, AFP | In this file photo taken on February 6, 2009, a pair of Rwandan Hutu rebels of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) stand in dense forest outside Pinga, 150km north-west of Goma, DRC.

A Rwandan Hutu rebel leader wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crime charges has been shot dead by the Congolese army, a DRC military spokesperson said on Wednesday.

Sylvestre Mudacumura, commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), was ""definitively neutralised"" in DRC's North Kivu province on Tuesday night, General Leon-Richard Kasonga said.

Mudacumura, wanted for charges including rape, torture and pillage, was killed about 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the capital of the province Goma.

The FDLR was created by Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern DRC after the genocide of Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighbouring Rwanda in 1994.

Its fighters are scattered across the eastern Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu as well as in northern Katanga.

The FDLR, opposed to the current Rwandan government, has not launched any large-scale offensive in Rwanda since 2001.

The group is regularly accused of committing atrocities against civilians in the zones it controls.

Eastern DR Congo has been torn for more than two decades by armed conflicts fed by ethnic and land disputes, competition for control of a wealth of mineral resources and regional rivalries.

"Terrorists shoot at bus in southwestern Rwanda, kill 2","Two people were killed and six were injured when suspected militants opened fire on a bus in southwestern Rwanda, Rwandan police said.

Saturday’s attack, which killed the bus driver and a passenger, was carried out by the National Liberation Front (FLN), the armed wing of the anti-government Movement for Democratic Change (MRCD), the police said in a statement.

“Armed thugs, suspected to be remnants of FLN operating from across the border, shot at a public passenger bus,” the Rwanda National Police said late on Saturday.

The police were tracking down the assailants in the incident on the Nyambage-Rusizi road in the district’s Nyungwe Forest, they added.

The government has said the FLN had launched attacks from the Nyungwe forest area close to the Burundi border in 2018.

In April, the Rwandan government upheld a 25-year prison sentence for Paul Rusesabagina, who was portrayed in the movie “Hotel Rwanda” sheltering hundreds of people during the 1994 genocide, for his involvement with MRCD.

He was convicted in September on eight terrorism charges, which he denies.",https://pmnewsnigeria.com/2022/06/19/terrorists-shoot-at-bus-in-southwestern-rwanda-kill-2/
Philippine soldiers shoot and kill journalist Ronnie Villamor at checkpoint,"Share this: Twitter

Bangkok, November 23, 2020 – Philippine authorities should independently investigate the circumstances surrounding the killing of journalist Ronnie Villamor, and hold those responsible to account, the Committee to Protect Journalists said today.

In the afternoon of November 14, Philippine Army soldiers shot and killed Villamor, a contributor to the local independent Dos Kantos Balita weekly tabloid, outside a military checkpoint in Milagros, a town in Masbate province in the central Philippines, while he was on his way to cover a disputed land survey, according to press reports.

The troops, led by Second Lieutenant Maydim Jomadil, were investigating reports of armed men in the area, according to local broadcaster ABS-CBN. Major Aldrin Rosales, the local police chief, alleged that the troops ordered Villamor to stop his motorcycle, and opened fire when the journalist drew a firearm, according to that report.

In a statement posted to Facebook, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines denied that version of events, saying that soldiers stopped Villamor and four surveyors he was accompanying despite the group having coordinated with police to be in the area. When the five decided to call local police to assist them in passing through the army checkpoint, the soldiers opened fire and killed Villamor, the statement said.

“Authorities must conduct a swift and independent investigation into the killing of journalist Ronnie Villamor, and ensure that any soldiers who acted unlawfully are brought to justice,” said Shawn Crispin, CPJ’s senior Southeast Asia representative. “Soldiers cannot simply gun down a journalist without fear that their actions will be thoroughly investigated and any wrongdoing punished. Prosecution of the perpetrators is the only way the cycle of impunity will be broken in the Philippines.”

Local English-language outlet Butalat reported that the army and police claimed Villamor was a member of the New People’s Army, an anti-government armed insurgent group active in the region.

The Presidential Task Force on Media Security, a government body tasked with resolving journalist killings, did not reply to CPJ’s repeated emailed requests for its assessment of Villamor’s killing and information on the status of any investigations into the case.

Villamor covered land disputes and other political issues for Dos Kantos Balita, according to the NUJP. The tabloid covers many hard-hitting issues, including illegal logging, drug trafficking, and illegal fishing in the region, according to a CPJ review of the publication’s Facebook page.

The Philippine Army did not immediately respond to CPJ’s emailed request for comment on the circumstances surrounding Villamor’s killing.

In October, CPJ published its annual Global Impunity Index, a ranking of nations where journalists are slain and their killers go free; the Philippines ranked seventh, with at least 11 unsolved journalist killings.",https://cpj.org/2020/11/philippine-soldiers-shoot-and-kill-journalist-ronnie-villamor-at-checkpoint/
Starbucks Reserve® Rwanda Hingakawa,"The miraculous story behind Starbucks Reserve Rwanda Hingakawa

“These women are my heroes.”



Arthur Karuletwa’s heroes are a group of all-female coffee farmers from his home country of Rwanda. They call themselves Hingakawa, which means “let us grow coffee.”



“These women have picked up this country from bare bones where the rest of the world had looked the other way. They needed each other like trauma needs counseling,” said Karuletwa, Starbucks director of global coffee traceability.



After the 1994 Rwandan genocide, trust was broken. The country was in turmoil.



“We’re talking about neighbors killing neighbors, ethnic groups wiping out other ethnic groups,” he said.



In the years that followed, coffee has helped bring reconciliation and revitalization to the country. And it wouldn’t have been possible without the women of Rwanda, including the Hingakawa group.







Traditionally, the men tilled the soil for cash crops, including coffee, and the women tilled the soil for food crops. But after the genocide, most of the men were dead, in prison or living as refugees in exile.



“For these women to entrust that there’s something that coffee can bring to their lives and their bottom line is…[nothing] short of a miracle,” Karuletwa said. “For them to learn from scratch, to learn from zero and to pick up coffee where it was left off, which is in a bad state, is also [nothing] short of a miracle.”







As the women began working to rebuild the coffee industry, they had to come together and trust each other again. They’ve shown grace and forgiveness at times when it might have seemed unimaginable.



“I’ve seen these women pick up the very icon, the very tool, which is an agricultural tool, and the irony around that is that this agricultural tool, the machete, was also the very tool that amputated people,” Karuletwa said.



It’s the same tool they now use to prune and weed their coffee. Karuletwa says the simple act of using the machete requires moments of connection and healing.





“These women wanted to bring their coffee together for the sole purpose of bringing themselves together.”

– Arthur Karuletwa,

director of global coffee traceability



The Hingakawa group, which started off with just a handful of women, is part of a larger co-op, Abakundakawa. Karuletwa says it’s an act of bravery for the women to ask permission from the co-op to actually separate their coffee from the rest of the farmers.



“You have to understand that in some of these cultures…gender equality is still what is regarded as taboo. Culturally, it’s not embraced, it’s not well yet understood. It’s still foreign and sometimes borderline dangerous,” Karuletwa said.









Today, there are around 150 members in Hingawaka. The women grow and process their own coffee together, including Starbucks Reserve® Rwanda Hingakawa. Karuletwa describes the coffee as elegant, just like the women who produced it.



“These women are my heroes not for what they’ve done on an industry standpoint, but what they’ve done on a human standpoint,” Karuletwa said.







Abakundakawa Co-op

The Hingakawa group is part of the Abakundakawa co-op.

The co-op was formed in 2004 and has nearly 2,000 members.

It’s located in the Gakenke district in the Northern Province of Rwanda.

Evil in the making,"What makes an armed man kill an unarmed civilian? What makes him join the killing of many hundreds — or hundreds of thousands — of civilians?

University of Amsterdam Professor of Social Science Emeritus Abram de Swaan takes a hard look at the subject in his new book, “The Killing Compartments: The Mentality of Mass Murder.” History is appallingly dense with examples, from medieval warfare to Nazi Germany to Stalin’s purges to Rwanda in the 1990s.



De Swaan talked with the Gazette ahead of a Tuesday lecture at the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies.

GAZETTE: You point out that genocide did not arise in the 20th century. Has it been with us always?

DE SWAAN: I’m afraid so. I avoid the term “genocide” because it has a very precise but rather problematic legal definition. I use “mass violence” for very large-scale, asymmetric encounters between organized and armed men — it’s usually men — and organized and unarmed other people.

In many times and places, a victorious army would routinely kill off whoever it could get ahold of, rape the women, enslave people, burn. Until, say, the 15th or 16th century, the chroniclers exaggerate the amount of bloodshed with glee and pride in what their army has accomplished and how much carnage was [done] in honor of the king or the great leader.

What is modern about genocide or about mass violence is the embarrassment about it.

GAZETTE: So it is not the practice that has changed, but our interpretation of it?

DE SWAAN: You could say that the scale has increased, with the emergence of a state system in which states are an enormous accumulation of the means of violence, including huge nuclear stockpiles. Internally, there is a domestic pacification, relative peace within every state territory, and so the overall figures for homicide, etc., decline in the course of centuries. This has been known by people in the profession for quite some time, and [Steven] Pinker in “The Better Angels [of Our Nature]” has popularized that insight. On the other hand, violence between states becomes ever more lethal and destructive on an ever-larger scale, but it happens more rarely.

Once war starts, victorious soldiers often regress into a state of triumphant rage and go on a rampage. The My Lai massacre [of the Vietnam War] is a classic example of what happens all the time in guerilla warfare, almost always in the colonial conquests of the Western powers. In a way My Lai was routine; what was new about My Lai was that the domestic audience found out. If this [kind of thing had] happened at the end of 19th century and a reporter had known about it, he probably would have shut up.

GAZETTE: Are there mass killings — and I assume we’re leaving out war itself — going on now?

DE SWAAN: I’m afraid so. Two examples that come to mind right away are Darfur, which has not stopped — very tragic and awful ― and the other, of course is ISIS.

GAZETTE: You drill down into the motivations of the perpetrators and poke holes in the idea of the “banality of evil” and the thought that any one of us in a similar situation might behave that way. Can you talk a little about that?

DE SWAAN: There is a rather surprising consensus in the entire literature on mass violence that ordinary people in what they call extraordinary — genocidal — situations commit extraordinary evil.

The first thing is, yes, that’s true. The second thing is that some people are more likely to get into those situations than others. And the question is, what sort of people are more likely to? Obviously people who are professional experts on violence: police, military people, violent criminals.

One could, with many caveats, say that certain characteristics are more likely to occur more frequently with genocidal perpetrators. For example, they have a working conscience, [but] restricted to family, their superiors, and their comrades-in-arms. Everyone else doesn’t count. Now, this is not that unusual a pattern of conscience formation, but usually education tries to inculcate a broader sense of identification with other human beings.

They [also] show a remarkably low sense of agency. This just happened to them, they didn’t know, they didn’t particularly want to, but one thing led to another. That may be an artifact of the fact that most of what we know is from when they appear before judges, so they have an interest in not looking like someone who knowingly and willing committed these acts.

GAZETTE: Is it hard to get at the truth of that part of the picture?

DE SWAAN: Yes, because you must realize that we know very little about these people. First of all, if they’re victorious, they’ll be heroes. If their side is defeated, then maybe some of them will appear before the judges and we’ll find out about them. This was the case in Germany. It was the case in Serbia and Rwanda, but think of China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia. It boggles the mind that, of all of these hundreds of thousand of killers, no one ever appeared before a judge. I say it’s one of the safest professions on the planet: mass murder.

The most striking thing is they seem to lack sympathy, compassion, pity. Sometimes it seems as if they don’t know what it is. There is a classic exchange in which the judge said, “Don’t you feel pity for all those you killed?” And the man said, “Oh yes, your honor, it was awful, I got all this blood and brains on my uniform. And the shouting and the shrieking of those women was impossible to bear.” The one he had pity for was the guy with the soiled uniform, which is just eerie if you think of it.

GAZETTE: You also mention the personal preparation — the individual circumstances — that needs to happen. You talked a bit about what Germany and individual Germans went through.

DE SWAAN: The general cultural or specific professional upbringing is enormously important. All Germans were exposed to 12 years of what may be the vilest lies and propaganda and vilification campaign in history. It was relentless; you could not hear alternative truth. And SS training [in particular] was specifically aimed at numbing any kind of compassion in almost perverse ways, sometimes so perverse that you don’t even want to talk about it.

GAZETTE: What do we know about SS training?

DE SWAAN: For example, they were made to shoot their own dogs. Dogs were highly valued, but you had to learn — a true SS man had to learn — to overcome their feelings if it was necessary for the Volk.

GAZETTE: What do you think is most important for the public to understand about these issues?

DE SWAAN: First, how often it occurs, how hard it is to realize that, yes, it really happened, and how difficult it is for any nation face its own crimes.

The Dutch have genocide in their history — in Aceh [Indonesia] — and there’s only one book — by a nonprofessional historian — about it. That’s the Dutch past, more than a century ago, but it was pretty bloody, about 100,000 people. And the terrible history of the Belgians in the Congo is very difficult to face. And the same goes for America.

GAZETTE: Clearly the treatment of Native Americans could qualify, but what’s your point of view on where America’s crimes of this nature have occurred?

DE SWAAN: I’m afraid that the Vietnam War and the bombing of Cambodia were horrible. I do not mention air war [in the book] because of the distance between the perpetrators and victims, but also maybe out of a shared Western blind spot.

Once the German air force was overcome, the Allied forces, the Western forces used the air war very intensely and sometimes very effectively and at relatively little cost. This has served the Western powers very well. And I am among those who have an underdeveloped moral capacity to judge that. So maybe somebody else should stand up and explain what the West has done.

GAZETTE: Dresden and Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

DE SWAAN: I feel very uneasy about it. Even at this very moment, we use bombing from the air. Those who are the object of that, for example ISIS, could say, “Look, they don’t even come out into the open, they’re manipulating their drones and bombing us and our families. Let them come out into a fair fight.”

And then we take literally the moral high ground and criticize them for their barbarous methods. But there must be a discourse going on — on the other side — which is not entirely devoid of moral dimensions. It’s a pity we don’t talk to those guys and those guys don’t talk to us, except in the most horrible way. They have a point and it would be a conversation — and I’ve never had it, nor have you, nor almost any of us. It would be interesting to see how we would come out if it.

GAZETTE: You stop beheading people and we’ll stop sending drones — that sort of conversation?

DE SWAAN: That sort of deal, yes. But probably they can muster as much moral indignation about our bombings as we can about their beheadings. I’m not saying that the truth lies in the middle. I’m not saying that both parties are equally evil. I’m just saying you might be in for a surprise if you were in an open conversation with one of those people.

GAZETTE: If you look at Nazi Germany, it almost sounds like an entire people were steeped in the propaganda. Is that situation, in a way, being recreated on the Internet, where people with a certain mindset can visit only areas where people who have the same point of view are, and create a similar echo-chamber effect?

DE SWAAN: I don’t know, I don’t much look into those sites. But the amazing thing is that, globally, you can find people exactly like you all over the world and then shield yourself off from any other opinion. So you can be secluded, provincial, parochial, on a global scale.",https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/03/evil-in-the-making/
Hotel Rwanda movie review & film summary (2004),"I have known a few hotel managers fairly well, and I think if I were hiring diplomats, they would make excellent candidates. They speak several languages. They are discreet. They know how to function appropriately in different cultures. They know when a bottle of scotch will repay itself six times over. They know how to handle complaints. And they know everything that happens under their roof, from the millionaire in the penthouse to the bellboy who can get you a girl.

Paul is such a hotel manager. He is a Hutu, married to a Tutsi named Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo). He has been trained in Belgium and runs the four-star Hotel Des Milles Collines in the capital city of Kigali. He does his job very well. He understands that when a general's briefcase is taken for safekeeping, it contains bottles of good scotch when it is returned. He understands that to get the imported beer he needs, a bribe must take place. He understands that his guests are accustomed to luxury, which must be supplied even here in a tiny central African nation wedged against Tanzania, Uganda and the Congo. Do these understandings make him a bad man? Just the opposite. They make him an expert on situational ethics. The result of all the things he knows is that the hotel runs well and everyone is happy.

Then the genocide begins, suddenly, but after a long history. Rwanda's troubles began, as so many African troubles began, when European colonial powers established nations that ignored traditional tribal boundaries. Enemy tribes were forced into the same land. For years in Rwanda under the Belgians, the Tutsis ruled and killed not a few Hutu. Now the Hutus are in control, and armed troops prowl the nation, killing Tutsis.

There is a United Nations ""presence"" in Rwanda, represented by Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte). He sees what is happening, informs his superiors, asks for help and intervention, and is ignored. Paul Rusesabagina informs the corporate headquarters in Brussels of the growing tragedy, but the hotel in Kigali is not the chain's greatest concern. Finally it comes down to these two men acting as free-lancers to save more than a thousand lives they have somehow become responsible for.

When ""Hotel Rwanda"" premiered at Toronto 2004, some reviews criticized the film for focusing on Paul and the colonel, and making little effort to ""depict"" the genocide as a whole. But director Terry George and writer Keir Pearson have made exactly the correct decision. A film cannot be about a million murders, but it can be about how a few people respond. Paul, as it happens, is a real person, and Col. Oliver is based on one, and ""Hotel Rwanda"" is about what they really did. The story took shape after Pearson visited Rwanda and heard of a group of people who were saved from massacre.",https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hotel-rwanda-2004

"'My soul is still in Rwanda': 25 years after the genocide, Roméo Dallaire still grapples with guilt","The Sunday Edition 1:15:17 Roméo Dallaire still bears psychological scars 25 years after the Rwandan Genocide (2019)

Retired Lt.-Gen. Roméo Dallaire does not mince words when speaking about Bill Clinton, who was U.S. president during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

In an interview with The Sunday Edition host Michael Enright on the 25th anniversary of the genocide, Dallaire listened to a 1998 speech in which Clinton expressed regret for not acting sooner.

""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began,"" Clinton told genocide survivors in Kigali.

Dallaire rejects that assessment as downplaying just how thoroughly the U.S. ignored the crisis.

""Most of it is crap,"" he said.

""A month before the genocide, [Clinton] produced a presidential directive that stated that the United States will not engage in any humanitarian operation, unless it's in its self-interest,"" he said. ""He had instructed his staff — and I've had the opportunity to meet with his subordinate staff — not to tell him what the hell was going on.""

Dallaire was in charge of the UN peacekeeping mission during the genocide against the Tutsi minority. In 100 days, more than 800,000 Rwandans — most of them Tutsis and moderate Hutus — were slaughtered by the Rwandan military and Hutu militia.

In the months leading up to the genocide, Dallaire repeatedly warned the UN Security Council something catastrophic was brewing. But he said world leaders were too concerned with preventing peacekeeper casualties to let him act.

Dallaire returned to Canada devastated and angry, haunted by his inability to prevent the genocide or convince the international community to do more to stop it.

""I've been under 20 years, nearly, of therapy. They have tried, by every means possible, to take away my guilt,"" Dallaire said.

""Command is sort of like being a woman who's pregnant. You can't be pregnant during the week, and on weekends have a break … There is no, 'I did my best and I'm sorry.' You are held accountable for your command. There is nothing that can take that away, and should never be anything.""

The Jan. 11 'genocide fax'

Dallaire was deployed to Rwanda with a small UN peacekeeping force in 1993. He was supposed to oversee a truce between the Hutus and the Tutsis, but his powers were tightly constricted by Chapter 6 of the UN Charter.

""You were supposed to be a facilitator, not a soldier, and the use of force was purely for self-protection,"" he said.

On Jan. 11, 1994, a commander told Dallaire militias were preparing to commit mass atrocities. He sent the UN Security Council in New York what is known as the ""genocide fax,"" saying he was prepared to take action — even though it fell outside the mandate of Chapter 6.

I got the fastest response from New York that I ever got: 'You will not intervene. You will not put troops at risk.' - Retired Lt.-Gen. Roméo Dallaire

""[The militias] would be able to kill a thousand Tutsis in 20 minutes, as they were planning. [We wanted] to try to go after the arms caches, and throw off the extremists from doing that,"" he said.

""After the 11th of January fax, I got the fastest response from New York that I ever got: 'You will not intervene. You will not put troops at risk.'""

Dallaire later learned that Clinton and the UN Security Council were reluctant to let him act because of what had happened in Somalia the year before.

In October 1993, an American special operations team launched a raid in Mogadishu, and two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Eighteen Americans, two UN peacekeepers and hundreds of Somali citizens were killed.

""There was a fear … that if I went in and did these things, that we'd end up in a firefight similar to Mogadishu, and I would take casualties,"" he said.

For two months, Dallaire kept asking the UN to let him take some limited actions to prevent violence.

""We were about to start doing them when the genocide started,"" he said.

Humiliation, mutilation and rape as acts of war

When the Rwandan president's airplane was shot down by a missile on the evening of April 6, 1994, Hutus blamed Tutsis. It was the spark that lit a bonfire.

Rwandan radio was full of calls to ""destroy the cockroaches,"" meaning the Tutsis. Death squads roamed the streets. People were hacked to death by machete — a slow, brutal process.

""They realized that, 'Hey, why just try to kill them? It's such a hell of a lot of hard work, and there are so many of them.' So they would cut breasts off, Achilles heel, they'd hit them around the neck — enough for them to just not be able to move, to stay in the sun and bleed to death. They would do that even with children,"" Dallaire said.

""It wasn't just wanting to kill them. They wanted them to suffer.""

The worst dimension, said Dallaire, was ""the introduction of a weapon of conflict that is used extensively still, that is considered by [the] International Criminal Court as torture, as a crime against humanity, and that's rape.""

Up to half a million women and children were raped, mutilated or murdered during the genocide.

Even once the genocide was underway, members of the UN Security Council continued to debate whether Dallaire had the mandate to act.

In 1994, Lt.-Gen. Dallaire spoke frequently with Michael Enright, who was the host of As It Happens at the time. In this interview, less than a month into the genocide, Dallaire said he and his troops were trying to remain optimistic more help was on the way. The Sunday Edition2:16'There is no desire to leave': May 4, 1994

He remembers speaking with UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali three weeks into the genocide, after more than 2,000 peacekeeping troops had already been withdrawn.

""He told me, 'Listen, the world cannot handle 450 peacekeepers being killed,'"" said Dallaire.

""I had a responsibility to the lives of my soldiers. But I also had a responsibility to the people of Rwanda.""

Aftermath

In mid-July 1994, the Tutsi guerrilla army finally prevailed. Hutus — both the guilty and innocents terrified of retribution — fled the country en masse.

In the aftermath, 40,000 people perished in cholera outbreaks in refugee camps.

Near the end of the conflict, Dallaire asked to be relieved of his command. He also began acting recklessly, hoping it might bring an end to his pain and guilt.

""Although I was ordered to have an escort, because of the death threats … I would escape from the headquarters and just go and drive,"" said Dallaire.

""I was always hoping that I'd end up in an ambush and I'd be killed.""

After returning to Canada, Dallaire attempted suicide four times.

One night, after an emotionally gruelling therapy session, he bought a bottle of scotch, sat on a park bench and drank the whole thing. He spent hours crying and preparing to end his life.

The Sunday Edition 1:39 'I remember crying and crying': Roméo Dallaire Roméo Dallaire talks to Michael Enright about his suicide attempts.

""I ended up walking in the park. I just barely made a couple steps, apparently, then I stumbled. Then I kept screaming for people to come and kill me,"" he said.

""I begged my sister-in-law, all the way to the hospital, and during the night when I woke up a couple of times. I kept screaming at her to find a way to kill me.""

He woke up ""sick as a dog,"" but alive. He channelled his pain and frustration into work.

""I worked and worked and worked to try to kill myself at work, because I wasn't succeeding in doing it any other way,"" he said.

'A large part of my soul is still in Rwanda'

Dallaire threw himself into projects to prevent the recruitment of child soldiers, because he realized many of the atrocities he witnessed in Rwanda were perpetrated by children.

He is heartened by the growing human rights field, and believes NGOs are starting to have more influence on public opinion and policy.

""There is a generation out there, under 25 ... they don't need borders. They can understand the environment from a world sense, they can understand human rights from all sides,"" he said.

""I've become more and more convinced that one day we will resolve our frictions without having to use force and conflict … It might take a couple of centuries, but I'm certainly giving it a shot.""

Dallaire said his desire to die finally ended a year and a half ago. But he believes he will never go back to being the person he was before the genocide.

""I still say a large part of my soul is still in Rwanda,"" he said.

There was a thin mist in the early morning air when we set off for the Rwandan capital, Kigali, on April 11, 1994. The genocide had begun four days earlier.

There were no flights into the country, so I and three fellow journalists crossed into Rwanda from neighboring Burundi, hitching a ride with a French priest who was shuttling Tutsi nuns out of the country. He took us to the town of Butare, where a Belgian inn keeper rented us an old cream-colored Renault and drew us a map of how to get to Kigali.

We drove north, winding our way through Rwanda's soaring hills and deep lush valleys. Our progress was soon slowed to a crawl by thousands and thousands of terrified Rwandans, fleeing — in almost complete silence — in the opposite direction, away from Kigali.

They were carrying whatever they could on their heads, their backs and in wheelbarrows. As we got closer to Kigali, we began to see deep pools of blood. There were discarded machetes, and bodies crumpled on the side of the road, their limbs hacked off.

We came to a checkpoint manned by a half-dozen Hutu militiamen, drunk and carrying machetes. They surrounded our car. One demanded my passport — he accused me of being Belgian, the colonial power that had kept the majority Hutu down.

He pressed his machete sideways across my neck. I could smell the alcohol on his breath as I tried to grab my Canadian passport from the front pocket of my jean shirt.

It felt like forever, but finally my hands stopped shaking long enough to undo the button. I showed him my passport; we passed the roadblock and made our way to the Hotel des Mille Collines — also known as the Hotel Rwanda.

I came to realize how lucky my escape was that day as I reported on the systematic butchery over the next three months. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in their sleep, trying to hide or seeking solace in a church.

They were burned and bludgeoned and hacked to death. Across Rwanda, towns emptied out, shops were looted and houses abandoned. Wild dogs roamed the streets feasting on corpses. You couldn't escape the smell of death. Every day I woke up thinking things couldn't get worse, but they did.

Even now, two decades later, images of my time in Rwanda will spring up. I see blood splatters on the walls of a church, with the bodies of hundreds of dead scattered on the floor.

There's the Canadian general, Romeo Dallaire, the head of the U.N.'s mission to Rwanda, tense and pacing outside the small U.N. compound in the capital. He had begged the world to help stop the genocide, but he was ignored.

And then there was the Hutu man I talked with several months after the genocide ended. Fat and middle-aged, he was in jail for beating to death more than a dozen of his Tutsi neighbors.

He told me they were people he'd been friends with and regularly shared dinner with. He was a godfather to one of the children he killed. He couldn't explain why; he said didn't know what came over him.

For me, this sums up the Rwanda genocide. It's like a madness took over the country, turning otherwise normal, reasonable, loving people into monsters. It took me a long time afterward to try to make sense of what I had witnessed.

But I finally concluded there was no use trying. I believe mankind, at its base, is good. What happened in Rwanda 20 years ago was an aberration.

Iranian Ex-Police Officer and November 2019 Witness on UK's Rwanda Deportation List,"An Iranian former police commander who gave first-hand evidence of atrocities committed during the November 2019 protests is at risk of being ""offshored"" from the UK to Rwanda next week.

The man arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker in May this year and is currently being held in Brook House Detention Center, a removal facility near an airport in England run by a private contractor on behalf of the British government.

Last November the ex-officer had testified via videolink to the Aban Tribunal in London about his experience overseeing a team of 60 police officers during the November 2019 demonstrations.

He fled Iran after being sentenced to five years in prison for refusing to open fire on peaceful protesters at the time of the unrest, when hundreds if not thousands were killed by security forces in Iran.

According to a letter sent to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel by the tribunal's co-counsel on Monday, seen by IranWire, the man was informed on March 31 that he will be deported to Rwanda for processing next week.

Under the terms of a highly controversial new deal, the UK government is poised to begin sending male asylum seekers who arrived in the UK ""illegally"" - via small boats across the English Channel - to the central African country to have their cases dealt with there.

Those whose asylum claims fail can be deported from Rwanda to their country of origin, which in the case of this individual could be tantamount to a death sentence. The first deportation flight is scheduled for Tuesday, June 14. Four Iranians are understood to be on the passenger list.

During the Aban Tribunal, the ex-police commander, then identified as Witness 195, told an independent panel of legal experts under oath that his unit had received a direct order to shoot at protesters on November 17, 2019: the same day security forces initiated a lethal crackdown on anti-government protests across Iran.

Witness 195 refused, and was later arrested and subjected to what he described as ""severe psychological torture"" at a detention center run by the Revolutionary Guards. This included being subjected to false claims that his family were dead. He was only allowed to contact them after going on hunger strike.

According to his own testimony, he was then tried in a behind-closed-doors military court in a hearing that lasted just 10 minutes, and subsequently sentenced to five years in prison, upheld by the Supreme Court on appeal.

The charges were “cooperation and coordination with protesters” and non-compliance with an order from the IRGC.

Parts of Witness 195's testimony were extremely sensitive even by the standards of what was heard at the tribunal. Among other things, he said he had seen IRGC snipers and plainclothes officers shooting at crowds “without any aim or purpose”.

The former policeman also corroborated others' testimonies that security forces had deliberately set fire to public buildings to foment a sense of chaos, giving their colleagues the jusfitication they needed to open fire.

Like tens of other Iranians who addressed the Aban Tribunal, Witness 195 spoke with his identity protected. His wife and children were in hiding at the time and other members of his family in Iran are still being harassed by the authorities.

In the letter to Priti Patel on Monday, Aban Tribunal co-counsel Hamid Sabi described him as ""a conscientious and brave citizen of the world"" with ""a genuine and well-founded fear of persecution in Iran"".

He added: ""Iranian agents were seeking his whereabouts while he was in Turkey by harassing his family members. Rwanda, having a close relation to the Islamic Republic of Iran, is not a safe haven. Please reconsider your decision for his removal.""",https://iranwire.com/en/november-2019-protests/104642-ex-police-officer-and-november-2019-atrocities-witness-on-uks-rwanda-deportation-list/
Rwanda’s president accused in death of ex-spy chief Patrick Karegeya,"PRETORIA, South Africa -- The death of a former Rwandan spy chief in South Africa has renewed opposition claims that Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, is orchestrating the killings of political dissidents – allegations denied by the Rwandan government.

Patrick Karegeya, the 53-year-old former head of Rwanda’s foreign intelligence service, was found dead on New Year’s Day on the bed in his room at the upscale Michelangelo Towers hotel in Johannesburg, according to South African police, who have launched a murder investigation.

“A towel with blood and a rope were found in the hotel room safe,” said police spokeswoman Katlego Mogale in a statement Thursday. “There is a possibility that he might have been strangled.”

The Rwanda National Congress, the opposition party Karegeya helped found, alleged in a statement Thursday that his death was one of numerous assassinations ordered by Kagame.

“By killing its opponents, the criminal regime in Kigali seeks to intimidate and silence the Rwandan people into submission,” the statement said.

Kayumba Nyamwasa, the former chief of staff of the Rwandan army, who like Karegeya was granted political asylum in South Africa, said he survived two assassination attempts while in exile.

“It is not new. It is not the first time, and it is not the last,” he said of Karegeya’s death, according to a report in the Guardian newspaper. “Most of President Kagame’s political opposition are in exile or in prison or are dead.”

The Rwandan government, as it has in the past, forcefully denied the allegations that it was behind the death. The Rwandan high commissioner in South Africa, Vincent Karega, told local broadcaster eNCA that talk of an assassination was an “emotional reaction and opportunistic way of playing politics.”

Rene Mugenzi, a Rwandan human rights activist living in London, said he was frustrated by the international response to such killings – or rather the lack of it.

“This is a very sad day, but it’s not new for Rwandans,” said Mugenzi, adding that he was informed by British authorities in 2011 that he too could be a target. “What is very frustrating, what is making me angry, is that the international community, the United Nations, the African Union, they have had information about what the Rwandan government is doing, but there has not been any condemnation.”

Martin Rupiya, executive director of the Pretoria-based African Public Policy and Research Institute, said he wasn’t surprised.

“Both the international community and African countries continue to feel that not enough was done in support of Rwandans during the genocide,” Rupiya said. “So explicit condemnation has been tempered because of that context.”

Still, he said, “If the evidence proves to be correct, then a very firm stand must be taken.”

Karegeya, a bespectacled man with a slight frame, reportedly fled to South Africa in 2007 after being jailed for insubordination and desertion, stripped of his rank as colonel and accused of plotting a coup with Nyamwasa.

Both men fought with Kagame in Rwanda’s 1994 war, which brought a stop to the genocide by ethnic Hutu extremists that killed more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

In exile, Karegeya and Nyamwasa formed the Rwanda National Congress. The Rwandan government issued international arrest warrants for the men in 2011. A military court convicted them in absentia on charges of promoting tribal divisions and threatening state security.

"25 years ago, photos helped show scale of Rwanda’s genocide — AP Photos","Twenty-five years ago, Rwanda descended into an orgy of violence in which some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by the majority Hutu population over a 100-day period in what was the worst genocide in recent history.

The massacres, mostly by gangs wielding machetes, swept across Rwanda and groups of people were killed in their homes and farms and where they sought shelter in churches and schools. The mass killings started after a plane was shot down on April 6, 1994, in the capital, Kigali, killing President Juvenal Habyarimana. The killers were encouraged by hate messages broadcast on radio stations. Rwandan police, military and other government authorities did not stop the killings.

Scores of thousands of terrified Tutsis fled Rwanda for neighboring countries including Congo, Tanzania and Uganda. The waves of murders continued until the rebel forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front took control of the country. Paul Kagame, who led the rebels, helped re-establish order in the country and served as vice-president and defense minister from 1994 until he became Rwanda's president in 2000. Under Kagame's leadership Rwanda has achieved stability and economic growth, although he is widely accused of being intolerant of criticism and of running a repressive government.

The scale of the killings in 1994 was unimaginable but the reporting and photographs taken at the time, for which AP won Pulitzer prizes, helped to inform the world of the horrors of the genocide.",https://apimagesblog.com/blog/2019/4/2/ap-was-there-karubamba-is-a-vision-from-hell

Sexual Violence as a Weapon of War,"‘Cheaper Than Bullets’: Sexual Violence as a Viable Strategy of Contemporary Warfare

Contemporary conflicts, often portrayed as ‘new wars’, are characterised by high levels of violence and inconceivable cruelty predominantly targeting innocent civilians (Kaldor 1998). Among many forms of violence, sexual violence has in recent years become a central focus of both academic study and journalistic writing. The prevalence of sexual violence in armed conflicts, and its systematic and widespread use against civilian populations, led many scholars to formulate a new concept that underscores the strategic use of sexual violence as a ‘weapon of war’. This framework focuses on exploring how sexual violence becomes a viable part of the military strategy directly employed by armed groups to achieve political and military objectives, as in the case of ethnic cleansing in former Yugoslavia or Rwanda. But how can this theory be applied to wars that lack clearly defined political and military goals, such as those that seem to be motivated by greed rather than grievance?

This paper will argue that, in order to apply the concept of the strategic use of sexual violence to contemporary wars, the analysis has to shift its focus. Instead of asking about the effectiveness of sexual violence in pursuing military agenda, one has to study how sexual violence is employed to further interests of armed groups, including their economic interests. Secondly, the prevalence of sexual violence will be explained as a product of a specific socio-cultural context that renders sexual violence as an extremely effective weapon of war in particular settings. In other words, this essay will bridge the gap between competing theories of sexual violence that ascribe its prevalence to different factors such as gender inequalities, cultural beliefs, social norms, etc.

Sexual Violence as a ‘Weapon of War’

There is little, if any, doubt that sexual violence constitutes ‘a coherent, coordinated, logical, and brutally effective means of prosecuting warfare’ (Gottschall 2004: 131). It is coherent in a way that it targets its victims, either selectively or indiscriminately, causing maximum damage in targeted communities through their exposure to most atrocious practices, e.g. gang rape, forced incest, sexual mutilation, etc. Regardless of the situations where the highest structures of military command give its soldiers explicit orders to commit rape, even in the absence of such instructions, testimonies of the survivors point out that the perpetrators seem to have planned the raid in advance and acted in a coordinated manner at the crime scene (Maedl 2011: 142).

Sexual violence, as other forms of conflict-related violence, is logical because it exploits local economic, social and cultural context in pursuit of strategic advantage by one military group over the other(s). Finally, it is very effective in producing concrete strategic results at a relatively low price. The fact that it is cheap and easily available, and at the same time it has a crushing and long-lasting effect on targeted populations, renders it an appealing tool of warfare, especially in conflict zones where the military actors do not have access to technologically advanced, expensive weaponry. Additionally, its efficiency lies in multiple functions of sexual violence in addressing and fulfilling physiological, psychological and social needs at individual and collective level. In other words, apart from achieving strategic goals in a military campaign, the use of sexual violence can bring additional benefits for its perpetrators, e.g. strengthen internal cohesion of units, boost group morale, serve as a prize (‘spoils of war’) for underpaid soldiers, release sexual, and psychological tension heightened in combat.

There are various strategic outcomes of using sexual violence as a tool of war. According to Cheryl Bernard, it can: 1) facilitate ethnic cleansing by making people flee their homes; 2) demoralise the adversary; 3) signal the intention to break up the society; 4) inflict trauma and psychological damage on the opponent; 5) provide psychological benefits to the perpetrators; and 6) inflict a blow against a collective enemy if the attacked group has a high symbolic value (Bernard 1994: 35-39). Moreover, the strategic functions of sexual violence are closely interlinked with the features of the conflict itself. In ethnic wars, which often turn into genocidal wars, rape and other forms of sexual violence often become ‘central technique in the technology of genocide’, as we have seen in the case of Yugoslavia, Rwanda, or, most recently, Darfur (Cohen 2011: 7). It causes a mass exodus of ethnic populations from disputed territories, ensures that displaced people will not return to their homes in the future, and serves to mark women of opposing ethnicity as ‘sexually contaminated’ (Cohen 2011: 7).

However, not all civil wars can be classified as ethnic conflicts. In fact, the multitude of actors and agendas fuelling contemporary conflicts makes it often impossible to clearly label them as political, ideological, economic, social, ethnic, or religious wars. Many scholars in recent years have turned their attention towards studying economic motivations as main drivers of contemporary civil wars (Collier & Hoeffler 2000; Agbonifo 2004; Ballentine & Nitzschke 2003; Berdal & Malone 2000; Bodea & Elbadawi 2007). When exploring links between war economy and intensity of violence, Jeremy Weinstein theorises that in ‘opportunistic rebellions’, which attract more rent-seeking individuals than politically committed activists, indiscriminate violence is used against civilians to gain access to areas rich in lootable resources such as gold, diamonds, minerals, and timber (Weinstein 2007: 205-209). Rape and sexual violence in this case might have a direct purpose of clearing out resource-rich areas for illegal exploitation, or it might serve to terrorise, pacify and demoralise local populations to make them more complacent, and, hence, prevent them from obstructing illegal economic activities of military groups.

Furthermore, since sexual violence has become highly publicised, it might be used as a strategy of diversion in a way it arrests public attention, which focuses solely on the problem of sexual abuse. Such strategy of disinformation might actually help in obscuring illegal economic activities taking place concurrently, and thus prevent international community from undertaking actions aimed at disruption of these illegal activities. Though there is not enough evidence in support of this thesis, a glimpse at the map of contemporary conflicts reveals that some of the major civil wars associated with illegal extraction of lootable resources (DRC, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, CAR) have also witnessed widespread sexual abuses. The existence and nature of the links between illegal extraction of resources and sexual violence have not been fully determined. Nonetheless, it is an interesting area for future study that might shed more light on the dynamics of ‘opportunistic wars’.

A Case Study of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

Conflict in the DRC is an example of a contemporary war that has been dominated by the narrative underscoring the scale of sexual abuse perpetrated by numerous armed groups operating in the eastern part of the country. Provinces of North and South Kivu, as well as Ituri, have been exposed to high rates of violence since the beginning of the Second Congo War in 1998. The involvement of many militias, both local and foreign, fighting for the domination over the territory, which is known to be abundant in natural resources (tin, gold, coltan), resulted in rampant violence decimating local populations, just as described by J. Weinstein. Sexual violence has been so widespread that the DRC has been dubbed the rape capital of the world by the UN officials. Sexual violence has been also perceived as a ‘particularly effective weapon to subdue, punish, or exact revenge upon entire communities’ (Pratt & Werchick 2004: 7).

The analysis of reports that collect data about victims and perpetrators sheds more light on patterns which characterise the use sexual violence in the DRC. Firstly, sexual violence targets its victims indiscriminately. Though women and young girls dominate in the victim statistics, both males and females, including children and elderly, fall prey to sexual abuse. Sexual violence takes different forms and involves rape with the use of foreign objects such as knives, glass, rusty nails, stones, peppers, bottles etc. Gang rape, forced incest, sexual mutilation and sexual slavery are common features of the conflict. They usually take place in front of the witnesses, including members of the family, and take form of the public spectacle. Furthermore, the victims of sexual violence usually report having their houses pillaged, property damaged, and family members killed or abducted.

The first observation stemming from this grim picture is that sexual abuse in the DRC is predominantly used instrumentally to terrorise targeted populations. According to victims’ testimonies, perpetrators’ objectives are to displace communities, instil fear within them, to punish them for the alleged collaboration with the enemy, transmit diseases (HIV/AIDS) and impregnate women with a view to disrupting the unity of targeted communities (Maedl 2011: 145).

Secondly, even though no substantial evidence points to the soldiers receiving direct orders to commit sexual atrocities, up to seventy per cent of the victims believe that the raids were planned in advance (Galloy, Sow & Hall 2005: 35). The raids on towns and villages, according to eye witnesses, are methodically executed in the presence of commanders who coordinate the actions of their militiamen, lending support to the claim that sexual violence is a part of military strategy.

Thirdly, the forms of sexual violence seem to be designed to cause maximum damage, with sexual mutilation and particularly brutal forms of rape affecting reproductive capabilities of women and girls, and often resulting in victims’ deaths. Since these particularly atrocious forms of sexual abuse do not provide a direct sexual gratification for the perpetrators, and the victims are chosen indiscriminately, regardless of their age, the perpetrators’ actions, at least in the majority of cases, are not motivated biologically and sexually, but rather seem to represent a scheme designed strategically, to instil terror in targeted populations. Furthermore, the social stigma and marginalisation that affect the victims contribute to the disintegration of family units and communities, making them more vulnerable and, hence, less able to defy and confront militias that prey upon them. Thus, armed groups are able to exert control over a conquered territory. As Sara Meger notes, ‘Sexual violence has proven an effective tool … effectively restricting freedom of movement and regular economic activity, giving the armed group the liberty to take over control of that economic activity without interference’(Meger 2010: 133).

In other words, in some opportunistic wars, as in the case of the DRC, sexual violence, like violence in general, is employed strategically to further economic interests of the armed groups, for which war economy is a source of personal gain. However, the prevalence of sexual violence, employed as a viable strategy by armed militias, is highly correlated with social and cultural factors defining given society, and thus depends on a local context that might encourage instrumental use of sexual violence.

Socio-Cultural Context

What makes rape and sexual violence such an effective weapon of war? How does it become so deadly in its consequences for the victims, and so beneficial for the perpetrators? If we define sexual violence in strategic terms, as a weapon of war, we have to turn to the definition of ‘weapon’ itself. ‘Weapon’ is a tool designed to inflict hurt and damage upon the adversary. In order to be effective, it needs to exploit the vulnerabilities of the target, be them physical, psychological or structural, and have long-lasting effects, rendering the target even more vulnerable, and, hence, prone to further abuse that would result in its defeat.

Sexual violence can be conceived of as an effective weapon of war because it exploits local context, i.e. socio-cultural narratives that serve as a basis for the creation of social norms and institutions that altogether guarantee social order at any level of human organisation. As Maria Olujic points out, ‘the use of sexual violence in conflict is an effective war strategy because of pre-existing socio-cultural dynamics that attach concepts of honour, shame and sexuality to women’s bodies in peacetime’ (Olujic 1998: 31-32). This view is supported by Cynthia Enloe, who writes:

If military strategists (and their civilian allies and superiors) imagine that women provide the backbone of the enemy’s culture, if they define women chiefly as breeders, if they define women as men’s property and as the symbols of men honour, if they imagine that residential communities rely on women’s work – if any or all these beliefs about society’s proper gendered division of labour are held by war-waging policy makers – they will be tempted to devise an overall military operation that includes their male soldiers’ sexual assault on women (Enloe 2000: 134).

Further support to this thesis can be found in testimonies of men and women of the DRC, who point out the significance of local customs in creating an environment that makes sexual violence a viable war strategy. In Congolese society, in which ‘women are generally perceived as the core of the community, as they are the caregivers, child-bearers, nurturers, and workers for the community’, sexual violence has a double impact (Meger 2010: 130). It is a physical as well as a symbolic attack on that community, which becomes polluted through violation of sexual integrity of women and girls. In patriarchal societies, such violation is equal to ‘social murder’, as the victims are perceived as ‘spoiled goods’ and rejected by their families and communities. Sexual violence constitutes also a message sent to husbands, fathers, brothers and other men in a given community, underscoring their failure to protect their women, households and community as a whole. Such communication serves the ultimate goal of splitting communities through infliction of shame and humiliation on their members. In the long run, sexual violence might effectively inhibit the ability of a given community to reproduce itself, thus it is equal to its extermination, which might play an important role in the agenda of armed groups seeking to exert total control over a disputed territory.

The analysis has focused so far on the socio-cultural dynamics of gender and traditional roles attached to being male/female in patriarchal societies, and thus accentuated the symbolic meaning of sexual violence targeting women and girls as community pillars. However, socio-cultural context has also a strong potential to explain the inversion of victim-perpetrator roles, i.e. the situation when males become victims, and women the perpetrators of sexual violence. Since masculinity is traditionally associated with power and domination, and femininity with submissiveness (hence victimhood), ‘to rape a man or to sexually violate him is to assert a status of power and aggression, a model of “masculinity”, to the perpetrator and to emasculate, feminise or “homosexualise” the victim’ (Solangon & Patel 2012: 427). For males, the consequences of being a victim of sexual abuse are far-reaching and include social rejection and marginalisation. For perpetrators (be them males or females), sexual violence, apart from helping to further strategic interests, might also serve to preserve or promote their status in the hierarchy of a military group (Cohen 2007; Cohen 2011; Gerecke 2009; Wood 2006; Wood 2009).

Conclusion

The analysis presented in this paper focuses on the conceptualisation of sexual violence as a weapon of war, i.e. how it is employed by military parties to the conflict to further their strategic interests. The main assumption of this essay is that, contrary to popular opinion expressed by many contemporary scholars, who deem the concept of sexual violence ‘weaponisation’ valid when its use is systematic, widespread, and helps to achieve military objectives of warfare, e.g. elimination of enemy defined in terms of opposing ethnicity, the nature of contemporary armed conflicts calls for a more comprehensive approach towards sexual violence. Due to the fact that many of the contemporary civil wars are characterised by variety of factors, with ‘greed’ being a chief motivation in the so called ‘opportunistic wars’, sexual violence should be understood as a means towards achieving strategic interests of particular groups, be them political, military, ideological or economic. For instance, the analysis of the conflict in the DRC sheds more light on how sexual violence can be used instrumentally to break up communities, rendering them more vulnerable and thus enabling the military groups to cease control of the territory. The fact that the control of the territory is equal to the control of the revenue from the illegal exploitation of natural resources is a factor that needs additional consideration.

However, the conflict dynamics in the DRC, and the way in which sexual violence fits into its landscape, though might serve as a point of reference in studying strategic use of sexual violence, do not produce a universal model that could be applied across different case studies. Nonetheless, one of the main findings of this paper underscores the importance of socio-cultural context in explaining why in some war settings sexual violence becomes such an effective weapon of war. Hence, sexual violence, though barbaric, heinous and atrocious, is employed when its use makes strategic sense, i.e. is capable of inflicting maximum damage at a low cost and high pay-off. This is what makes it such a deadly efficient tool of warfare.

One dead in Kigali grenade explosion,"By IVAN R. MUGISHA More by this Author

One man died and 11 others were injured when a grenade exploded inside a hair salon in Kimironko, a suburb in Kigali, Rwanda, on Thursday.

The deceased man is reported to have said that “he was carrying something in his pocket”, which he tried to show the barber, according to the Rwanda Police Statement.

Rwanda: 20 years later,"“I like helping people. I would have become a doctor,” says Andrew, 50, sitting in his neatly kept house. Poverty had other plans for Andrew. Unable to afford college, he built himself a house near his parents in 1985. Two years later he married Madrine, now 50, and they started their family.

“During that time, I was living a great life,” he says. “I had many relatives around me and many friends and neighbors who were like a big family. Things were very good.”

Callixte, now 42, was part of the circle of friends. The two had always been fond of one another. “He was a very sharp kid,” Andrew says of Callixte. “He was very active in school. He was always number one in writing poems and singing.”

Callixte looked up to Andrew. “He was older than me, but he liked selling things that kids liked,” says Callixte. “He sold groundnuts and biscuits, so I always came to him to buy things. He was a very good person.”

Andrew says his village was a place of “peace and harmony,” where people came together for weddings and other ceremonies. Until April 1994. “Things changed all of a sudden, and people started killing each other,” Andrew says. “People had lost their minds.”

Neighbors turned on Andrew’s family. His wife, Madrine, was a Tutsi — a target for killing. Andrew tried to protect her and her relatives. “They did their best to hide,” he says. “Some even came to my house. They were discovered and killed.” Madrine survived but lost her father, mother, and five siblings.

Part of the mob that killed them was Callixte, whom Andrew had loved since childhood.",https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/rwanda-20-years-later

Excerpt: Art from Trauma,"The following is an excerpt from Art from Trauma: Genocide and Healing beyond Rwanda (August 2019) edited by Rangira Béa Gallimore and Gerise Herndon. The excerpt is written by Natalia Ledford.

I first met Chantal Kalisa in 2009 as I was finishing my first year at the University of Nebraska. I had just completed a unit in my African history class, which was studying the events of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. During one of the most efficient genocides in history, one million people were killed within just one hundred days. I distinctly remember leaving class and questioning what state Rwandan society could be in fifteen years later, when I passed a bulletin board and my eyes fell on a flyer that read “UNL Summer Study Abroad in Rwanda.” The next thing I knew I was meeting with Chantal, who would be leading the three-week field study. Upon introducing myself, I learned that she was Rwandan but grew up in exile in Burundi. Much of her extended family had still been in Rwanda in 1994, and many of their lives were lost during the genocide. I was struck by her poise when she explained that the reason she had focused so much on this point in history academically was because it had affected her on such a personal level. Before Chantal, I had never had a professor who could connect to her subject matter in such a profound way, and perhaps for that reason she became one of the most important mentors I would ever have.

I was a journalism student at the time and was developing a passion for documentary filmmaking. Chantal was not a journalism professor, yet she influenced me as a storyteller more than anyone. When I asked her what she thought about an idea I had to shoot a documentary during our field study, she responded by pointing out that even with good intentions it’s possible to do more harm than good when seeking out stories in a country like Rwanda. She proceeded to paint a picture of Western journalists over the past fifteen years from the perspective of many survivors. She told me to imagine droves of Americans, Brits, Belgians, and so on, showing up just after the genocide and shoving cameras in the faces of survivors, patronizingly asking them about their trauma before even asking if they wanted to be filmed. As this had been the experience of too many people, I had to understand that the camera itself, if not used wisely, could easily become a source of trauma even if the intention is to empower. As I listened to her, I realized there was much I had yet to learn about Rwandan society, and I assumed Chantal would end the conversation by advising me to forget the whole documentary idea. Instead she surprised me. As she completed this short lesson on the perils of irresponsible storytelling in Rwanda, she told me it’s still possible to approach a story the right way and that many survivors indeed wanted a platform from which to tell their stories. One just needed to understand how complicated it could be to do this the “right way” when your subjects are people who have lived through extreme trauma and injustice.

Then she said something that I have never forgotten and that I still repeat to myself every time I pick up my camera. She said, “This is all to say, that before you start filming, the most important thing you have to ask yourself is, ‘What are my intentions here?’ Do you want your subjects to do something positive for you, or do you want to do something positive for your subjects?” She believed a journalist who intended the former would not take the consent, dignity, and limits of a survivor as seriously as a journalist who intended the latter. She was drawing the line between what she saw as exploitative endeavors and what she saw as empowering ones.

If my goal was to empower, I would have to attempt to see the world from the perspective of a society that had survived a horror beyond anything I could comprehend. Before our departure for Kigali, she took the time to sit with me on numerous occasions and converse about different scenarios we might encounter in Rwanda as I filmed my short documentary. She managed to be cheerful, humorous, and inviting even while asking me to critically analyze the deepest layers of my own Western socialization, my privilege, my assumptions about Africa, and my role as a filmmaker. She always stressed how hyperconscious people must be about their own conditioning, as well as about the invasive dangers of Western hegemony, before stepping into another country and assuming they understood what was going on.

Her perspective and many criticisms about conventional media portrayals of Africa made her a remarkably influential and important mentor for me. At that time the media seemed full of video clips of the intrepid Western reporter standing in African refugee camps, walking up to starving children and mothers, speaking about their turmoil in front of them, yet as if they weren’t there, seemingly without their consent. The intent was always to shine a light on their victimhood. Chantal pushed her students to question this approach. This arguably degrading style of reporting was rarely ever used to cover tragedies in Western countries, so why was it the norm in Africa? By making me question conventional approaches to international reporting, Chantal helped me determine what type of storyteller I wanted to become. She would always point out that recognizing the full humanity of those on camera would mean honoring their dignity and giving them agency over their own testimonies.

When we finally went to Rwanda, the experience changed my life, so much so that I ended up going back a year later to shoot a long-form documentary. We entitled it Komora, which in Kinyarwanda means “to heal.” The documentary focused on the orphan survivors of the genocide in Rwanda and was codirected by our friend Emmanuel Habimana.

At the age of nine Emmanuel survived the genocide, and by codirecting a film about a history he shared with fellow orphans, he was in a position to educate viewers on a level that only he could reach. If it weren’t for Chantal I’m not sure if I would have understood the importance of giving survivors an opportunity not only to speak in front of the camera but also to guide the film itself from behind the camera.

It was a little jarring at first to return to Rwanda without Chantal, yet I soon realized she had become the voice in my head, and in that way she always felt present. It turns out that this feeling endures years later, even after her death. I got the news of her sudden passing after I moved to Guatemala, a country that continues to struggle against the same forces that led to its own genocide in the 1980s. As I move through this space and look for internal guidance for how to support Guatemalan survivors of extreme injustices, I constantly find myself asking, “What would Chantal say about this? What would Chantal tell me to do?” An answer tends to come quickly and set me at ease. I can’t know how many different students, colleagues, friends, and family members she inspired, but I think it’s safe to guess that she lives on in all of us in the same way she lives on in me: as a guiding light always insisting that we listen first, speak second, and never stop questioning our own intentions as we establish our places and purposes in the world.",https://unpblog.com/2019/08/27/excerpt-art-from-trauma/
Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak,"""This gentleman I killed at the marketplace, I can tell you the exact memory of it because he was the first. For others, it's murky- I cannot keep track anymore in my memory. I considered them unimportant; at the time of those murders I didn't even notice the tiny thing that would change me into a killer.""



Susan Sontag wrote the preface for Jean Hatzfeld's book Machete Season. She says: To make the effort to understand what happened in Rwanda is a painful task that we have no right to shirk- it i

Susan Sontag wrote the preface for Jean Hatzfeld's book Machete Season. She says:(If you've ever read one of Susan Sontag's introductions and then read the book with a ""Well, this bowl of risotto didn't give ME an orgasm"" reaction then you know how hard it is to hit those octaves after one of hers.)I agree that it is an important issue. Because it is important, Hatzfeld may have been let off the hook on pretty important things.He contradicts himself repeatedly in Machete Season. Sometimes on the same page (I'll get to that later). I could have dealt without the constant comparisons to the holocaust. I really could have dealt without the measuring of one tragedy against another. Hatzfeld is in love with the word ""genocide"" and wastes time downgrading the tragedies of war, such as the horrific slaughter of Sbrenicans, because the women weren't systematically wiped out to prevent future breeding. If you see people as a group, not as individuals, then genocide is worse. I think killing people is bad if killing people is bad. I am at a loss why he felt he had to take time out of his book to say that what happened in Rwanda was worse than what happened to others, with the sole exception of Jewish people in the holocaust. I've seen this kind of thing before. The sixty-three million killed by Chairman Mao was not as bad as the twelve million killed by Hitler because it wasn't against different people than his own. People are people, people! I would think it would be important to question why life isn't so precious that war is inevitable.The first time I wore my ""Are you fucking kidding me?!"" face was on page ninteteen/twenty.(This is an historically stupid statement. I don't think I need to say why.)Hatzfeld doesn't bring up colonization until page 210 and then he refers to it as ""over simplistic"" if you did think it was an unmitigated factor. Maybe the Belgian author didn't want to mention that the idea of ethnic identity cards did not arrive spontaneously into the minds of either tribe, that it was their Belgian colonizers who put the (as Hatzfeld disturbingly to me refers to them again and again) ""slender"" and ""beautiful"" Tutsis over the Hutus. The setting up of one group over another group seems to be a common factor in the matter of people doing fucked up shit to each other. The slow dehumanization over a period of time so that people get used to it and won't see it as wrong. Hatzfeld was busy shoehorning the Rwandan murders to fit next to the sickness of the Nazi regime and bypasses Cambodia on the grounds that he is more familiar with the former. Revenge, as well as racism, played a large part in the Cambodian genocide. Corruption under ""leaders"" set up under the French, and a memory that doesn't let go of the most twisted resentment turned brutal. Like the Hutus, the Khmer Rouge didn't have a plan beyond extermination. Today's itinerary is blood. Tomorrow? Blood. Hutus didn't have to remember what it was like during the centuries the Tutsis reigned over them. They inherited the grudges. To dismiss colonization boggled my mind a little. I would also say that the shooting down of the plane with the Hutu president was a catalyst. But what about the hundreds of Tutsis that the killers interviewed admitted drowning in rivers? The murders of their neighbors that they were getting away with before the summer of 1994? The Nazis did build up to it. The conclusion that I came to is it wasn't a big deal to the killers because they thought they were going to get away with. That is what the gang of Rwandan killers tell Hatzfeld himself. They say this more than once and it is said by more than a few killers. They felt they were not going to be liable for their crimes with an authority of society. That was the missing ingredient in the pot. That is why so many went along with the Nazis, why men who had once lived aside Jews could kill them. These Rwandan men had been simple farmers. If you are going to write a book about the killers in an attempt to understand why they did what they did, why would you focus your attention on the victims (Hatzfeld has a prior work about them)? Setting up differences between the groups is wrong. I had a lot of ""But what about?"" moments that would appear later in the book. Hatzfeld talks a little about Christopher R. Browning's book Ordinary Men somewhere in the last fifty pages (if you haven't read it I highly recommend that you do so) about how simple Polish men could turn into killers and follow through with the executions of all of those people. If any group could be turned on and wiped out then is it also true that anyone could turn into a killer? The similarities was in the killers. If they knew what would have happened afterwards that would have been a deterrent if ""It is wrong to kill other human beings"" was not.Interviewing the men inside the prison of Rilima was an inspired choice. Here Hatfeld knew what he was doing. The men in Browning's book were hard to reach through the threat of imprisonment. Bypassing the fear of judgement is another matter. (A feeling that I had throughout was for those other Rwandans suspected by the world for murder. Eyes on them regardless of their possible innocence. Some have been exonerated. Did they get a plaque of proof for this? Did the men who shot down the plane of the Hutu president and then fled to refugee camps in Uganda think about the outcome they were setting up a million people to endure? Does anyone in a power play ever consider the casualities?) Choosing the men from a group of friends was even more inspired. The group mentality for killing is also what allows them to feel protected. It wasn't just me! His idea was that their insulated world of judgement within their own group would keep them honest. An inmate who denied responsibility would have to point the finger at the others. He would not be allowed into the shadows under their shoulders. All they had left of their old lives was this group. I don't know how accurate Hatzfeld's observations of the powerplay within the group was, though. It is too easy to assume the role of leader onto Adalbert, or prejudices about Tutsis onto the crotchetchy old-timer who was also acknoweldged to have killed the least, despite his years of threats against the people. It was ridiculous when he would dub one member ""more repentant"" than another member and then a paragraph later decide that a different guy was more honest and forthright in his confessions than the others. The book is best when letting the men speak and allowing the reader to try and know them through these. The back and forth admissions that they either couldn't remember the first kill or that those black eyes were pools they could drown in if they sunk for even a moment (no one actually says this. I'm guilty of my own editoralizing). I appreciate that it must have been frustrating for Hatzfeld to rely on testimony that would one day be open and the next as closed off as if they had just met. I wasn't reading the book so that those guys could be sorry enough, though.The worst part of the killings was when they had outside help from neighboring hills. These men would collect more of the loot, or force them to work harder. Sometimes the reports are contradictory. They were helpful for those men who weren't naturals with their machetes (those who were used to killing goats had an advantage). Some men preferred farming as the easier work. Others thought it was a better day to go out and kill before the afternoons off to drink banana beer in cabarets (I thoroughly enjoyed the glimpses of their old lives. Both slavishly backbreaking work and taking what pleasures they could out of football. It's simple if you don't think too hard about the women who had to put up with no rights and alcoholic husbands, anyway). It all depended on who was talking or when you asked who was talking. Sometimes they claimed that they were forbidden their afternoon naps. You could get killed yourself if you lagged off. I believe that it was kill or be killed. If they had collectively not wanted to exterminate their neighbors it could have been done. They were informed of the plan before it happened (local authorities and teachers were let in on the plan so that they could tell everyone else in secret meetings). I didn't get the sense from this particular group interviewed that it was a concern of theirs, the lives of the Tutsis. That they were thinking about their own lives? Yes. It does make me think about people who ""go along"" with evil regimes. It may well be that the female Hutus were not kill! kill! kill! as their husbands claim they are (Hatzfeld talks to them too, thank goodness. I sensed a terror of these killers). I was disturbed by reports, by the killers, that some wives were JEALOUS of the Tutsis women raped by the men. I'm hesitant to sweep any one under the rug because of cultural influences so I can't decide for myself if the reason they didn't help (at least not as a whole) Tutsis was from their place in society of leaving all decisions up to the man of the house. When the book begins it is told from Adalbert's mother. I felt for this woman who had twelves sons. The cocky son who assumed control of them all had been drinking the night before. She knew that he was not going to be working in the farms that day (which would mean no food for them) and would instead head off to the cabarets with his friends. Not knowing that the plan had been set in place it reads that they pick up their machetes and go out to kill as wordless mind reading. Maybe like underwater beasts who can talk in ways that we cannot understand. They did have their own language of violence, however premeditated it was. I don't know that it was inevitable one bit. That's what makes it all the sorrier for them all. This is about so much more than judgement. That's why I think Susan Sontag overrated Hatzfeld's book. Judgement and understanding aren't necessarily the same thing.I feel that the value of Machete Season lies a lot in that he interviewed the men as a group. Through them, as a group, I got a sense of their own lives that they murdered when they first pick up their machetes and kill. They want it to go back to the way it was before they knew that this could have happened. I'm not surprised that the remorse isn't crying out for the lives that were lost (is haggling over the definition of what qualifies as a genocide doing that either? The Tutsis cow numbers are back to their pre-1994 numbers. If the same was said of the population they would still not be the same lives that were lost!). I can still see that there was more lost in this than flesh and blood. It cannot ever go back to what was. Not as a letting off the hook because they were caught up in what everyone else was doing. I recently reread David Grossman's wonderful The Yellow Wind about the Palestinian/Israeli conflict (I highly recommend this book too) and in that book he wrote about George Orwell's said about how you demean yourself if you are an occupier. I need to reread Orwell's elephant story about losing his will to that crowd of Burmese behind him. He is holding the gun and they are holding him with their expectations. You can't just go home after you went all that way and face this enormous beast with your gun. You can't go back to that life after you have taken it,e either. It would take something that is just your own to be able to go home without taking theirs. I am all for that you are enslaving yourself if you decide to be authoritarian over someone else. Hell no do I let them off the hook for anything they did (and if you are going to wonder why the hell this happened why would you ignore that it WAS born out of the Tutsis rule over the Hutus? Was nothing bad going to come out of that? Fuck ""ethnic claim"" over land. There is no law of the land that can't be washed away with blood. There is no way that this is over either).I don't understand how they could do it. I believe the men that they were terrified of the other Hutu killers. I know that they were right when they say that they would not have been able to stop killing, that they would turn on each other. Some of those men are in Congo and raping hundreds of women. The UN pulled out of Rwanda with no haste. I thought this recent article by Rachel Vincent from Ottawa Citizen was illuminating. Arresting the perpetrators. What a novel idea. I really want to know why nothing was done when they were killing the Tutsis to begin with? When hundreds were rolled into rivers? Why were they there at all, then? Call me a cynic but playing around with millions in foriegn aid for their own jobs may have more to do with it.Oh yeah, the contradictions. Hatzfeld would write that no Hutus stood against the killer Hutus. Later he had a chapter about Hutus who did just that (they were killed). It was kind of cheesey the way he would dub them ""the just"" every time. Guess he never saw that film Hotel Rwanda. That makes me think of some Italian film from around 2006 that I forget the name of. The ads bragged that this Italian diplomat saved more lives than were on Schindler's List. Um, I didn't know it was a contest. Or that German film Sophie Scholl because the Germans needed, for their peace of mind, to cling to any small sign that one of their own resisted the Nazis. Thinking that one could redeem a group isn't right, to my way of thinking. The question should be how come people don't stand up more often? Would they if they saw more people do it? Would more people be enraged that the Holy Land Five are in prison for sixty-five years for providing humanitarian aid to Palestinian women and and children if it weren't socially acceptable to hate Muslims and despise them all as terrorists? If the party line wasn't ""If you have nothing to hide..."" would they care that others are constrained against the bonds that don't (yet) affect them? A recent and disturbing incident from my own hometown: The police department asked the VICTIM of a crime to pay for the cost of the investigation because he was a drug user and his kidnapping and hostage taking was therefore his own fault. Yes! How long before all victims are blamed? (Something like when Obama said that teen who was killed by drones should have had a better father. A neat little way to dehumanize someone.) What would the Rwandan men do if their countrymen returned and started raping their own women? The setting up of ""groups"" over another group... It sounds simple to say but that is fucked up and answerable to a lot. It terrifies me. Does it terrify you? That's all I've got on why this shit happens. They may have had something inside of them that wishes it never happened. It wasn't enough to stop it from happening.- Roland BarthesDehumanization: Don't do it! Says that wise speaker (ha) Mariel. For that I appreciate that Jean Hatzfeld wrote this book. They are people too, as simple as it is for me to say it (it doesn't feel simple to say it. I have a lot of boiling frustration inside over people who don't even notice that black people are so much more likely to go to prison than white people. POOR people. My frustration is turning into rage a lot these days over justification of asshole behavior that does not need to be so). I feel for those Tutsis survivors who have to live on those hills with people who had tried to kill them. How did it feel to accept it as ""the way it is"" to make love to a husband who had been killing? To insist it was all them, not me if you had escaped prison. I feel for those future generations who are grown up now with this as their inherited memory. Memories get distorted. There's no way to tell what that will be. I think one of the most disturbing parts of the book were the accounts of the Rwandan men who taught their children how to kill. It is their culture for the children to learn tasks by shadowing their parents movements. Some kids practiced on corpses, others practiced on children. Amnesty would later release from prison anyone under fourteen who killed. I wonder what they are doing now. I wonder who is going to remember who did what. I wonder if they'll see each other as people and not go ""you did that"". The Hutus men bore grudges against Tutsis who were not the same Tutsis just as they were not the same Hutus who suffered under their rule. Will they be the same as they were then in 2012, in 2044?",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189296.Machete_Season
Somali Forces Shoot and Kill Iranian Sailor in Indian Ocean,"Somali regional officials say the Iranian captain of a fishing boat was killed and another sailor was injured after security forces opened fire during an operation in the Indian Ocean.

Officials said the shooting occurred after Puntland Maritime Police Forces spotted two boats suspected to be fishing illegally Friday in Somali waters.

Colonel Mohamed Abdi Hashi of Puntland police told VOA Somali the two boats ignored orders to stop and attempted to escape.

“Our security forces were conducting an operation on October 6, they encountered two illegal fishing boats off Ras Hafun coast. When they tried to stop them in order to check their permits they escaped,” he said.

“They managed to seize one of the boats, the other one escaped.”

Colonel Hashi said during the shooting captain Haydar Abdalla Sabiil of the vessel Al-Sa'idi was killed and a second sailor was injured, 16 others are unharmed and were apprehended, he said.

The boat carrying the sailors have arrived at Bosaso port for questioning. The boat is carrying two tons of fish illegally caught in Somali waters, officials said.

“The boat is now docked at Bosaso port, the body of the captain is in the freezer of the boat, and according to the law we transferred the case to the courts.”

Officials did not release the name of the dead sailor.

Colonel Hashi says he wasn’t sure if Somali political leaders have made any contact with Iran about the incident.

""We are just soldiers, it’s possible that Puntland leadership have contacted Iran but I’m not aware of contact.”

Recurring problem

Illegal fishing in Somali waters occurs often according to maritime organizations. Most of the boats illegally fishing in Somali waters come from Iran, Yemen, China and number of Southeast Asian countries, according to the organizations.

A 2015 report by the U.S.-based watchdog, Secure Fisheries, says foreign fishing boats caught more than 132,000 metric tons of fish off Somalia in each of 2013 and 2014, while local fishermen caught only 40,000 metric tons. In monetary terms, foreign vessels have out earned their Somali counterparts by nearly $250 million per year, the report said.

Other maritime organizations have often warned illegal fishing sparks increases of piracy activities in Somalia waters.

In late 2015, Puntland seized six boats and dozens of sailors from Iran and Yemen. They were all released after heavy fines and confiscation of their catch.

Last year, Somalia received a $65,000 fine from the owners of Belize-flagged vessel, Greko 1, which was found guilty of fishing illegally in Somali waters.

The European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR), which combats piracy activities off the coast of Somalia, tipped the Somali authorities and international watchdogs about the fishing activities of Greko 1.

Jacqueline Sherriff who is a spokesperson for the EUNAVFOR tells VOA Somali an important part of its mandate is to monitor fishing activities off the coast of Somalia.

“That vessel, the only reason that we could successfully prosecute that vessel is because the EUNAVFOR provided photographic evidence and location evidence that it was actually illegally fishing in Somali waters,” she said.

Sherriff said the EU office in Brussels works with the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, an intergovernmental organization responsible for the management of tuna and tuna-like species in the ocean, to investigate illegal fishing cases.

She said if EUNAVFOR naval ships see a vessel that is not Somali actively engaged in fishing they take a note of the vessel, its location, its name, the color of the vessel, what type of fishing gear it has deployed and then pass on the information to the maritime watchdogs.

Two dead in bus explosion in Uganda: Police,"At least two people died and several were wounded on Monday in an explosion on a bus near Kampala, police said, two days after a deadly attack in the Ugandan capital claimed by the Islamic State group.

Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said bomb specialists were sent to Lungala following a deadly explosion in a bus belonging to the firm Swift Safaris around 5 pm (1400 GMT).

""Two people have died and several were injured when an explosion went off in one of our buses from Kampala to western Uganda this evening,"" Enanga said in a statement.

He added that wounded people were being evacuated from the area.

""The scene has been cordoned off pending a thorough assessment and investigation by the bomb experts. We shall periodically give updates surrounding the incident.""

Enanga gave no more detail on the suspected causes of the explosion.

The initial toll was confirmed by a manager of Swift Safaris.

Lungala is about 35 kilometres (22 miles) west of Kampala, on one of the country's busiest roads, linking Uganda with Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The blast follows a deadly explosion that killed one person and injured three at a roadside eatery in the capital Kampala on Saturday, which police called an ""act of domestic terror"" and for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility.",https://www.wionews.com/world/two-dead-in-bus-explosion-in-uganda-police-423968
Law on police use of force in Rwanda,"[The] Rwanda National Police is generally responsible for ensuring security of persons and property throughout the country. ... A law determines the governing principles, powers, responsibilities, organisation and functioning of the Rwanda National Police.

The right to freedom of peaceful and unarmed assembly is guaranteed. This right is exercised in accordance with the law. This right does not require prior authorisation, except when provided for by the law.

Everyone has the right to physical and mental integrity. ... No one shall be subjected to torture or physical abuse, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

A human being is sacred and inviolable. ... The State has an obligation to respect, protect and defend the human being.

Everyone has the right to life. ... No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of life.

Rwanda's 2003 Constitution (as revised in 2015) address fundamental human rights in its Chapter IV. Article 12 concerns the right to life:

National Legislation

Police Use of Force

The use of force by the Rwanda National Police is regulated under a dedicated 2010 law. Two key provisions in Section 5 of the law govern police use of force, one which has general application and the other that is specific to the use of firearms.

Article 37: Use of force The Rwanda National Police may use appropriate means of force if it realizes that its objective cannot be achieved otherwise The use of force has to be lawful, reasonable and proportionate to the objective. The use of force shall be consistent with laws governing police officers.

These general provisions on use of force conform to the requirements of the international law of law enforcement.

Article 38: Use of firearms The Rwanda National Police shall endeavour to accomplish its mission without using firearms. A police officer may, where necessary, use a firearm if:

1. he/she has unsuccessfully tried other means of force;

2. he/she is subject to violence or has to assist other persons who are subject to violence when no other means are available;

3. he/she he/she is fighting armed persons and cannot protect persons or property he/she is supposed to protect by any other means;

4. he/she has to arrest notorious criminals or any other armed persons.

The provisions governing use of firearms are considerably broader than is permissible under international law. They would allow use of firearms against an unarmed suspect who was resisting arrest and do not require an imminent threat to life or of serious injury.

Use of Force in Custodial Settings

In general, a prison guard is required to accomplish his or her responsibilities ""without use of force"". However,

he/she may use appropriate force in order to accomplish his/her duties in absence of other means available to accomplish them.

Use of force shall be applied reasonably and not excessively beyond the gravity of the committed crime.

Under the 2006 Prisons Act, a prison guard is empowered ""to use appropriate force to prevent escape of the prisoner"". The provisions on use of firearms are especially permissive in this regard:",https://www.policinglaw.info/country/rwanda
"The U.S. and the Genocide in Rwanda 1994: The Assassination of the Presidents and the Beginning of the ""Apocalypse""","Around 8 PM local time on the evening of April 6th, 1994 the plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down over Kigali, Rwanda as the presidents returned from a summit of regional leaders in Tanzania. Both men died, as did their senior aides and the French aircrew. Within hours, the Presidential Guard was out on the streets setting up roadblocks in Kigali and going house-to-house to find and attack prominent Rwandan opposition leaders and Tutsi civilians.

As Lt. Gen. Dallaire, the UN commander in Rwanda, recalls ""In just a few hours, the Presidential Guard had conducted an obviously well-organized and well-executed plan-by noon on April 7 the moderate political leadership of Rwanda was dead or in hiding, the potential for a future moderate government utterly lost."" (Note 1)

The genocide in Rwanda had begun.

With reports of the deaths of the presidents, Washington--and the world--reacted. The U.S. government responded with statements offering condolences and condemning the violence; established inter-agency committees and intra-agency task forces to monitor the situation and coordinate policy; contacted Belgian and French officials to coordinate a response; and ordered the evacuation of American citizens from Rwanda. These documents highlight what the U.S. knew and how it responded in the first three days of the crisis.

Document 1: U.S. Department of State, Bureau of African Affairs, Memorandum from Acting Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Prudence Bushnell through Under Secretary for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff to The Secretary, ""Death of Rwandan and Burundian Presidents in Plane Crash Outside Kigali"", April 6, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release; previously published here in ""Evidence of Inaction"")

Deputy Assistant Secretary Prudence Bushnell, acting head of the State Department's Africa bureau as Assistant Secretary George Moose was returning from Africa, wrote to Secretary of State Warren Christopher to advise him of the plane crash and the deaths of the presidents, which occurred in the afternoon Washington-time of April 6th. Bushnell reports ominous signs: ""the Rwandan military prevented the UN from inspecting the site"" and ""reportedly disarmed the UN (Belgian) peacekeepers stationed at the airport."" She informed Tarnoff and Christopher that ""the military intended to take power temporarily"" and that there was ""an increase in sporadic gunfire and grenade explosions"" in Kigali. Finally, Bushnell warned ""widespread violence could break out in either of both countries, particularly if it is confirmed that the plane was shot down."" As part of the U.S. response, Bushnell noted that the UN Special representative had arranged a meeting between ""the military and Western diplomats at the U.S. Ambassador's residence"" for the next morning. That meeting never occurred; UN forces, already burdened responding to pleas for help, could not provide an escort for the Special Representative. (Note 2)

Document 2: ""Burundi/Rwanda: Presidents Killed"", Excerpt from U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Secretary's Morning Summary, April 7, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release; previously published here in ""Information, Intelligence and the U.S. Response"")

The Secretary's Morning Summary is just that--a summary report of important intelligence items produced for morning delivery to the Secretary of State, which is also distributed to senior officials of the State Department and other departments and agencies. This Summary item reports the shoot-down of the plane, offering as potential culprits ""hard-line Hutu soldiers, the former rebels of the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), or someone else seeking to fan Hutu-Tutsi tensions."" Noting the political and historical connections between Rwanda and Burundi, State analysts indicate ""The incident may also spark an upsurge in violence in Burundi.""

Document 3: ""Rwanda-Burundi: Presidential Deaths Likely to Renew Fighting"", Excerpt from Central Intelligence Agency, National Intelligence Daily, 7 April 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release; previously published here in ""Information, Intelligence and the U.S. Response"")

CIA produced the highly-sensitive National Intelligence Daily six days of the week for top policymakers at the White House, State and Defense departments and other agencies. (Note 3) On April 7th, CIA analysts predicted the shoot-down of the plane would cause ""Hutus in Rwanda"" to ""seek revenge on Tutsis"" and predicted that ""the civil war may resume and could spill over to Burundi"".

Document 4: U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, ""SPOT Intelligence Report as of 08:45 EDT April 7, 1994: Rwanda/Burundi: Turmoil in Rwanda"", April 7, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release)

The State Department's intelligence arm, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, produced intelligence appraisals beginning shortly after reports of the shoot-down of the plane in Rwanda. SPOT reports are intelligence reports written 'on-the-spot' intended to 'flag' severe problems for senior Department of State officials. This report from the morning after the shoot-down relays information provided by U.S. Ambassador David Rawson in Rwanda. Rawson-who had already met with Col. Theoneste Bagosora, the genocide's mastermind, Gen. Augustin Ndindiliyimana, the head of the National Police, and Ephrem Rwabalinda, the army's liaison to UNAMIR that morning-reports that ""rogue Hutu elements of the military-possibly the elite presidential guard"" shot down the plane, although another report blames the RPF, which ""denied responsibility."" ""Military elements"" are also identified as killing the opposition Hutu Prime Minister and ""the killing of several other Rwandan cabinet officials including the senior ranking Tutsi."" At this point, ""the fighting appears to be limited to the capital"". Explaining the violence, the analysis concludes ""Ultra conservative Hutus had been opposed to the peace settlement agreed to by the Hutu Rwandan government and the rebel Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).""

Document 5: U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, ""SPOT Intelligence Report as of 13:00 EDT, April 7, 1994: Rwanda/Burundi: Violence Update, No. 2"", April 7, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release)

U.S. defense attaché Lt. Col. Charles Vuckovic USA was posted to the U.S. Embassy in Cameroon, but he also had responsibility for Rwanda-thousands of miles across the African continent. Coincidentally, Vuckovic had arrived in Rwanda on April 5th. Given his background, his reporting proved useful to Washington policymakers and his presence contributed to the evacuation of American citizens. This heavily censored appraisal from later in the afternoon of April 7th conveys information from Lt. Col. Vuckovic that Rwandan Army Headquarters ""reports that the Presidential Guard is ""out of control"" on the streets of Kigali while all other military units remain in their barracks"". Lt. Col. Vuckovic saw ""no effort by other military units to stop the presidential guard"". His report, while again identifying the Presidential Guard as key perpetrators of the violence, otherwise suggests control, organization and discipline among the regular army.

Document 6: The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, ""Statement by the President: The Deaths of the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi"", April 7, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release)

President Clinton's statement expresses his shock at the deaths of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira. He ""strongly condemn(s)"" the murders of Rwandan officials, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, by ""elements of the Rwandan security forces"", and calls on ""all parties to cease any such actions immediately.""

Document 7: United Nations Security Council, ""Statement by the President of the Security Council"", S/PRST/1994/16, 7 April 1994 (Accessed at www.un.org)

Colin Keating, New Zealand's Ambassador to the United Nations, sat as President of the UN Security Council during April 1994. Keating's statement reports the deaths of the presidents, ""the deaths of Government leaders, many civilians and at least ten Belgian peacekeepers"", and strongly condemns these horrific attacks and their perpetrators."" Specifically identifying the parties involved, the President's statement urges ""the Rwandese security forces and military and paramilitary units to put an end to these attacks and to cooperate fully with UNAMIR"", the UN mission in Rwanda.



During his term, Keating pressed hard for a UN response on Rwanda, arguing early to increase the strength of UNAMIR (Note 4) and urging a Security Council declaration of ""genocide"". His efforts were in vain; the Council's permanent members-the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China-succeeded in suppressing any Security Council initiatives.

Document 8: U.S. Department of State, Telegram State 092008, ""WGRW01: Working Group Formation to Deal with the Situation in Kigali and Bujumbura"", April 8, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release)

At 1 PM on April 7th, Secretary of State Warren Christopher established a ""24-hour working group"" as ""the center of all Department activity"" concerning ""the situation in Kigali and Bujumbura."" The task force concluded its work April 15, following the evacuation of American citizens and the closure of the U.S. Embassy. Notably, at this early stage, the State Department apparently perceived the crisis as confined to the capitals of both countries.

Christopher appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary Bushnell as head of the task force. Bushnell would go on to play a major role in the U.S. response to the genocide; after the working group concluded, she headed an inter-agency task force designated with monitoring the crisis and developing and implementing the U.S. response.

Document 9: ""Rwanda: Downward Spiral"", Excerpt from U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Secretary's Morning Summary, April 8, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release; previously published here in ""Information, Intelligence and the U.S. Response"")

This summary for top State Department officials reports that ""Rwandan troops had kidnapped and killed"" Belgian troops serving in the UN mission, as well as the murders of Rwandan government ministers. It also reports ""the army high command"" assertion that ""a missile fired by Hutu hardliners in the presidential guard (PG) downed the aircraft"" carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi. State Department analysts conclude ""The PG hardliners were operationally in a position to take action""; although evidence is lacking because ""the PG has sealed off the site"", it is notable that ""no one in the Rwandan high command is blaming the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) for shooting down the plane.""

Document 10: ""Rwanda: Security Deteriorating"", Excerpt from Central Intelligence Agency, National Intelligence Daily, 8 April 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release)

CIA analysts report to top U.S. officials that ""Hutu security elements from the Presidential Guard, gendarmerie, and military yesterday killed several government officials-including the Prime Minister""; ""killed numerous Tutsi civilians in Kigali""; and ""killed two Belgian civilians and 10 of the 450 Belgian UN troops"". Their report adds ""what remains of Rwanda's civilian leadership and moderate senior military officers appear unable to restore order"", suggesting the hardliners have killed or put-down opposition and are pre-dominant.

Document 11: U.S. Department of Defense, Memorandum from Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict through Under Secretary of Defense for Policy to the Secretary of Defense and Deputy Secretary of Defense, ""Rwanda: Current Situation; Next Steps"", April 8, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release; previously published here in ""Information, Intelligence and the U.S. Response"")

This memo informs Secretary of Defense William Perry and Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch of talks between the rebel RPF and Rwandan government under the auspices of UN Force Commander Dallaire. Pentagon officials see ""a glimmer of hope that this crisis is waning."" Pentagon officials describe the Presidential Guard as ""Hutu-extremists who probably shot down the President's plane"".

With regard to the U.S. response to the crisis, Pentagon officials inform Perry and Deutch that that the State Department and National Security Council have not sought Pentagon input for their response to a Belgian request for airlift-the first evidence of policy disagreement and bureaucratic infighting on Rwanda that would continue throughout the crisis. Finally, the officials report that ""the French, Belgians, and the UN are all discussing evacuation of citizens/PKO forces"" and that U.S. military planners are ""meeting with Belgian and French military"". Within 10 days, almost all Western officials and Western citizens will have left Rwanda to its fate.

Document 12: U.S. Department of State, Telegram State 093509, ""Situation Report as of 1600 EDT, 04/08/94, EDT"", April 8, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release)

Under the power-sharing Arusha Accords, the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front had stationed a battalion within Kigali, although all other RPF forces remained north of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in northern Rwanda or at camps in Uganda. In addition to killing prominent Hutu and Tutsi civilians, Rwandan military forces attacked this RPF battalion. On April 8th, RPF forces launched across the DMZ ""because the ceasefire had been violated, its Kigali contingent had been attacked, the Rwandan army is killing officials and Tutsis, and the UN is unable to control the situation"" as RPF leader Paul Kagame told a U.S. defense attaché.

The resumption of the civil war had important consequences: for the RPF, it was necessary to rescue both their comrades in Kigali and to rescue Tutsi civilians; for the Rwandan military, it served to solidify ranks which were divided over the military's involvement in killing civilians and taking power; for the interim Rwandan government, it would provide an excuse for prosecuting a war against the RPF and any civilians it considered ""accomplices"" of the RPF, including Tutsi women and children, and it directly threatened the government's existence; and for outside observers, including the U.S., UN, and others inexperienced with Rwanda's history, it confused the killing of civilians with fighting between regular forces and discouraged outside intervention, particularly in the wake of the U.S. and UN experience in Mogadishu.

Document 13: U.S. Department of State, Executive Secretariat, ""Situation Report No. 6; Situation as of 1630 EDT, 04/08/94"", April 8, 1994 (Freedom of Information Act release)

By the close of April 8th, the situation was bad and getting worse in Rwanda, Western nations wanted out, and they acted decisively. This Rwanda task force situation report notes ""the Belgian government has decided to evacuate its citizens"", but is still ""willing to keep their UNAMIR troops in Rwanda after the planned evacuation"", while ""the French have agreed to take control of the airport"". This report also describes White House involvement in the crisis, recording ""NSC has given approval to State and DoD to plan for a joint U.S.-Belgium-France operation to evacuate our respective nationals."" It also reports that the Belgian Prime Minister and the UN Secretary General want to ""strengthen"" UNAMIR at least with ""equipment and/or firepower"" if not ""with more troops"". Instead, a week after the UN force finished assisting the evacuations by Western nations, the UN Security Council voted to gut the force and leave Rwanda to its fate.

DR Congo Wildlife Guards Kill Two Rebels After Ambush,"Two suspected members of a Rwandan Hutu rebel group were killed after ambushing guards at DR Congo’s famous Virunga National Park, the park’s authorities said on Tuesday.

A joint patrol of guards and government troops came under attack on Monday between Mabenga and Kasali in the heart of the park, the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN) said in a statement.

The suspected attackers were the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) — an ethnic Rwandan Hutu group that has been active in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo for more than two decades.

“A member of the (joint patrol) suffered a serious gunshot wound… (while) two assailants died, one was arrested and an AK47-type weapon was seized,” the ICCN said.

The oldest national park in Africa, Virunga is home to specular species of wildlife, including mountain gorillas.

The 97-year-old haven extends across nearly 8,000 square kilometers (3,000 square miles), including the border areas with Rwanda and Uganda.

The ICCN is tasked with protecting and conserving Virunga and the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The FDLR is historically linked to figures who took part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which around 800,000 people, mainly from the Tutsi minority, were slaughtered.

Burden of non-communicable diseases on the rise,"3 October 2016 - The World Health Organization (WHO) in Uganda made a presentation on the burden of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) to the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Uganda under the theme “Non-Communicable Diseases: An Epidemic in Revolution”. The meeting was hosted by World Food Program at their offices in Kampala.

The WHO NCD Focal point Dr. Hafisa Kasule, made the presentation on behalf of WHO highlighting the Global trend of NCD burden, which shows that there is an increase of the NCD burden in low income countries at 25 million deaths reported in 2015 and estimated to shoot to 27 million by 2030.

According Health Management Information System (HMIS) surveillance, the NCD burden in Uganda, is on the rise. For instance in Outpatient Department (OPD), High blood pressure (hypertension) increased from 60,000 cases between 2012-2013 to 85,000 cases between 2015-2016; an increase of 42% in just three years. Diabetes case registered in OPD increased by 7% from 30,000 to 32,000 over the same period.

Obesity, tobacco use, poor nutrition and high blood pressure were highlighted as some of the major modifiable risk factors fueling the escalating NCD epidemic in Uganda.

A national NCD risk factor survey conducted in 2014 showed that screening for cancer of the cervix, the leading cause of cancer death in Uganda, was only 10% among women aged 30-49 years. Furthermore the survey revealed that 10% of Ugandans aged 18-69 years have at least three risk factors for NCDs with 20% aged 45-69 years having more than three risk factors.

The WHO Global Action plan for the prevention and control of Non Communicable diseases 2013-2020, focuses on prevention and control of the four modifiable risk factors including tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet rich in saturated fats and refined sugars and low in vegetables and fruits and physical inactivity. These four risk factors lead to four intermediate physiological factors which are overweight/obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and raised blood glucose/diabetes. These risk factors ultimately lead to four diseases cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic lung diseases and diabetes, which account for 82% of global death due to NCDs. NCDs also caused 68% (38/56 million) deaths in 2012 which was greater than death due to all other causes combined.

The UNCT recognized the global and local threat of NCDs and agreed to work together in a coordinated manner to support multi-sectoral action by government for prevention and control of NCD. in Uganda. The UNCT is comprised of Country Representatives of all the United Nations Agencies in Uganda.",https://www.afro.who.int/news/burden-non-communicable-diseases-rise
Study finds Rwandan genocide chemically modified the DNA of victims and victims’ offspring,"Scientists with the USF Genomics program and the Center for Global Health and Infectious Disease Research have taken a significant step in providing the people of Rwanda the scientific tools they need to help address mental health issues that stemmed from the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi ethnic group.

In a first-of-its-kind study, Professors Monica Uddin and Derek Wildman of the College of Public Health looked at the entire genomes of Tutsi women who were pregnant and living in Rwanda at the time of the genocide and their offspring and compared their DNA to other Tutsi women pregnant at the same time and their offspring, who were living in other parts of the world.

In the study published in Epigenomics, they found that the terror of genocide was associated with chemical modifications to the DNA of genocide-exposed women and their offspring. Many of these modifications occurred in genes previously implicated in risk for mental disorders such as PTSD and depression. These findings suggest that, unlike gene mutations, these chemical “epigenetic” modifications can have a rapid response to trauma across generations.

“Epigenetics refers to stable, but reversible, chemical modifications made to DNA that help to control a gene’s function,” Uddin said. “These can happen in a shorter time frame than is needed for changes to the underlying DNA sequence of genes. Our study found that prenatal genocide exposure was associated with an epigenetic pattern suggestive of reduced gene function in offspring.”

The team, which includes Clarisse Musanabaganwa, a visiting scholar from the University of Rwanda and her colleagues, came to their conclusion following the review of DNA from blood samples from 59 individuals – about half exposed personally or exposed in utero to the genocide. Exposure is defined as being impacted by genocide-related trauma, such as rape or evading capture, witnessing murder or serious attack with a weapon and seeing dead and mutilated bodies.

The novel study is part of a larger consortium, the Human, Heredity & Health in Africa (H3), which is funded by the National Institutes of Health. It’s an effort to empower scientists in Africa in genomics, increasing their independence and ability to build the infrastructure needed to enhance genetic studies across the continent, and ultimately better capture data on the human genome across the world.

“The Rwandan people who are in this study and community as a whole really want to know what happened to them because there’s a lot of PTSD and other mental health disorders in Rwanda and people want answers as to why they’re experiencing these feelings and having these issues,” Wildman said.

While this study looks specifically at the impact of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, it supports previous studies that show what occurs during pregnancy when one is a fetus can have long-term impacts – many symptoms not appearing until later in life. Such evidence proves the need to enhance efforts to protect the safety and emotional and psychological wellbeing of pregnant women.

Researchers point out that individuals who were in utero during the genocide are starting to have children of their own and they hope to soon look at whether that trauma has had an epigenetic impact on the third generation. They’re now awaiting a new, larger batch of DNA samples to find out how trauma can impact risk for specific mental health disorders, such as PTSD.",https://www.usf.edu/news/2022/study-finds-rwandan-genocides-chemically-modified-the-dna-of-victims-and-victims-offspring.aspx

Uganda-Rwanda relations worsen as Rwandan security shoot two dead Rukiga district,"The territorial police in Kigezi is investigating the shooting to death of two male adults, one a Ugandan and the other Rwandan, by the Rwandan security forces, an incident which has worsened relations between the two countries. The murder occurred, yesterday at around 8pm, at Hamisavu, trading center, Kiruhura village, Kasekye Parish, Kamwezi Sub County, in Rukiga District, according to Uganda Police Spokesperson Fred Enanga.

The Rwandan citizen, identified as Peter Nyengye was a businessman, who attempted to cross into Rwanda on a motorcycle, loaded with his merchandise, but turned back upon noticing security presence across the border. He was however, chased and intercepted by two armed Rwandan soldiers, a distance of about 80 meters, into Ugandan territory, at Hamisavu trading center.

“The victim resisted attempts to arrest him, and was shot to the head and killed instantly. The armed soldiers. In addition, shot dead a Ugandan identified as Alex Nyesiga, who was trying to intervene. They immediately withdrew, after failed attempts to remove the body of the Rwandan victim. The two bodies were transferred to Kamwezi Health Center IV for further post-mortem analysis,” Enanga says.

Stories Continues after ad

“The police strongly condemn the violent acts of killing innocent civilians with impunity, regardless of their immigration status. In this very instance, there was no justification for the illegal entry and use of deadly force by the Rwandan military, due to the presence of alternative, adequate and effective remedies available at our disposal,” reads part of Uganda Police statement on the matter.

“For instance, in the recent past, 44 Rwandan nationals, who had illegally entered Uganda, were intercepted in Kasese district and deported to Rwanda in a very peaceful manner,” it adds.

As we forward the matter to the National Security Committee and Ministry of Foreign Affairs for better management, we would wish to urge our counterparts, to respect the rights of citizens along the border and avoid acts of provocation that can easily destabilize the prevailing peace along the border, says Enanga.

The latest incident comes at the time when Uganda has accused Rwanda of imposing a trade embargo on its goods as it does not allow the goods to enter Rwanda. Rwanda accuses Uganda of harboring rebels opposed to Kigali regime but Uganda denies the allegations, calling them unfounded. Rwanda has gone ahead to block its citizens from entering Uganda on allegations that Ugandan security mistreats them when they arrive in the country.",https://eagle.co.ug/2019/05/25/uganda-rwanda-relations-worsen-as-rwandan-security-shoot-two-dead-rukiga-district.html
Concerns about shelter as Congolese refugees arrive in Rwanda,"Congolese refugees arrive at the Nkamira Transit Centre in Rwanda. © UNHCR/A.Bronee

NKAMIRA TRANSIT CENTRE, Rwanda, May 7 (UNHCR) - Teenager Arsène is all alone in Rwanda; he was separated from his family in the rush to flee fighting between government forces and renegade troops in eastern Congo.

""When the soldiers started to shoot, I ran. I thought my family was following,"" the 15-year-old told UNHCR after arriving at the Nkamira Transit Centre. He was one of more than 6,200 people to flee to Rwanda from Democratic Republic of the Congo's North Kivu province since April 27.

Most are women, children and the elderly coming from North Kivu's Masisi and Walikale territories, where the fighting between government forces and soldiers loyal to former rebel commander Bosco Ntaganda also left almost 20,000 people internally displaced. News reports on Sunday said the army had ended its operations against mutinous troops.

Arsène said the fighting was chaotic, and civilians were caught in the crossfire. ""I first heard gunshots, then I saw soldiers coming from behind a hill. One soldier was shot in the head. I do not know which side he was fighting for, all soldiers were wearing the same uniform,"" he recalled.

""I fled only with the clothes on my back,"" said Arsène, who was wearing his white school shirt under a dark blue sweater. ""I am in Rwanda, but I am alone now,"" the boy said, his voice growing soft.

Sarah's family were also separated in the flight to Rwanda from their village in Masisi territory, which lies to the west of the North Kivu capital, Goma. She was working in the fields when the conflict swept into their area.

""Suddenly, our neighbours came rushing by, screaming. They said there was fighting in the area, so I hurried home. Two of my children were gone, I don't know where they ran. I took my [other five] children, I took a few kilos of beans, and I ran,"" the 40-year-old widow said, with a resigned look.

People have become almost inured to the cycle of violence in eastern Congo, and many have been displaced several times. Others resting in the massive warehouse tents (rubb halls) in Nkamira have similar tales to Sarah. But she also remained hopeful, purtting her faith in the ability of UNHCR and its partners to help find her missing two children.

This latest influx of people from North Kivu has put great strain on the Nkamira Transit Centre, which was visited on Sunday by officials from North Kivu, including Governor Julien Paluku Kahongya, who thanked Rwanda for hosting the refugees and said he hoped they could all go home soon.

After crossing into Rwanda at the border town of Gisenyi, the new arrivals have been transported by UNHCR and its partners to the Nkamira Transit Centre, 22 kilometres to the east. They are provided with food and items such as plastic mats, jerry cans, and crockery, but shelter is a major concern because the transit centre was only built to accommodate 2,600 people. With the urgent rehabilitation of 19 old rubb hall tents and the construction of 13 new ones, the capacity will be increased to 5,400.

Meanwhile, the government of Rwanda, UNHCR and many of its partners have worked tirelessly to provide clean water, sanitation facilities and basic health services. But if people continue arriving at a high rate, there will soon be critical gaps in humanitarian assistance.

Liz Ahua, deputy director of UNHCR's Africa Bureau, warned that ""a new site will have to be found if more refugees continue to arrive on a daily basis.""The rate of arrival has fallen since last week, but almost 400 entered Rwanda on Sunday.

While the UN refugee agency is discussing longer-term solutions with the Rwandan government, urgent donor support is needed in the short term. Rwanda is already hosting some 55,000 Congolese refugees who live in three already crowded camps across the country.

In recent years, the Nkamira Centre has hosted Rwandans as they returned to their home country from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They stayed here for one or two days before being transported to their villages of origin by UNHCR.

Remembering the Rwandan Genocide,"Remembering the Rwandan Genocide

Today marks twenty years since the onset of the Rwandan Genocide. On 7 April 1994 began the worst instance of genocide since World War II, when members of the Rwanda’s Hutu majority slaughtered an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in one hundred days of hell.

The sheer scale of this atrocity staggers the mind and heart, with roughly 70% of the Tutsi population killed at that time. Magnifying the horror was the chillingly brutal way in which the killings were carried out. Most of those killed were hacked to death with machetes, sometimes after watching their loved ones tortured, raped, or killed first. The UN Special Representative to Rwanda at the time, Shaharyar Khan, says in The Shallow Graves of Rwanda, “The Interahamwe made a habit of killing young Tutsi children, in front of their parents, by first cutting off one arm, then the other. They would then gash the neck with a machete to bleed the child slowly to death but, while they were still alive, they would cut off the private parts and throw them at the faces of the terrified parents, who would then be murdered with slightly greater dispatch.”

The immensity of this tragedy sears in our minds, but in remembering the Rwandan Genocide, we must move beyond scale and statistics, and grasp that each life lost represents a family, a community, a nation changed forever. The Outreach Programme on the Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations features testimonies from survivors, and I urge you to read a few. This will be difficult reading, but the words of the survivors are crucial in capturing the reality of the pain they endured, and also a necessary step to ensuring that such atrocities never happen again.

How could this mass murder be perpetrated so widely and for so many endless weeks while the international community stood idly by? In the aftermath of the genocide, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated to Frontline news that “the failure of Rwanda is 10 times greater than the failure of Yugoslavia. Because in Yugoslavia the international community was interested, was involved. In Rwanda nobody was interested.”

Why is that? “Are all humans human? Or are some more human than others?” asks Roméo Dallaire in Shake Hands With the Devil. Are we more willing to go to the aid of someone who is more like us, or does every human count in our fight for human rights? Dallaire recognizes this slippery slope: “How do we pick and choose where to get involved? Canada and other peacekeeping nations have become accustomed to acting if, and only if, international public opinion will support them – a dangerous path that leads to a moral relativism in which a country risks losing sight of the difference between good and evil, a concept that some players on the international stage view as outmoded.”

So today, twenty years after the outbreak of this harrowing brutality, we reflect on the hundreds of thousands of Rwandans who were butchered, but we should also reflect on the great failure of the international community to intervene. Most importantly, today we should ask ourselves: Have we learned anything from this great tragedy? If it happened today, would the Western world take notice and act immediately and decisively to end the violence and spare lives, in Africa or elsewhere?

At the Sentinel Project it is our mandate to engage people in preventing atrocities. We work to shed light on situations that teeter on the brink of costing many lives, and we do so with the intention of preventing such violence. We use the technology available to design and implement early warning systems so that the tragic narrative of Rwanda never repeats itself.

Sometimes, I get terribly sad because I can’t imagine what my life will be like. I’ll never see my parents again, and yet I’ll see the people who killed them, and those people’s children, for the rest of my life. I can’t bear the thought of it.

The Atlantic: This is Resilience,"One of the most horrific tales of mass violence ever began just 20 years ago this week. During the 100 days after Easter 1994, ethnic Hutu extremists killed 1 million fellow Rwandans. The surviving 80 percent of the population reeled from health crises.

Health workers fled or were killed. Many who remained had been complicit in the genocide, seeding distrust in medical establishment. An estimated 250,000 women were raped. HIV became a weapon of war. Refugee camps fell to one of the century’s largest cholera outbreaks. Rwanda was left with the world’s highest child mortality and lowest life expectancy at birth. Fewer than one in four children were vaccinated against measles and polio.

“Whether survivor, perpetrator, or member of the diaspora, no Rwandan emerged unaffected,” writes Rwandan minister of health Agnes Binagwaho in The Lancet today, in a study co-authored with Dr. Paul Farmer and a team of international public health experts. “Much of the rest of the world stood idly by.”

Few imagined that Rwanda, a country the size of Maryland, would so soon—if ever—serve as an international model for health equity.

Just two decades later, that life expectancy has doubled. Vaccination rates for many diseases are now higher than those registered in the United States—more than 97 percent of Rwandan infants are immunized against ten different diseases. Child mortality has fallen by more than two thirds since 2000. New HIV infection rates fell by 60 percent between 2000 and 2012, and AIDS-related mortality fell by 82 percent. HIV treatment is free.

“In the last decade, death rates from AIDS and tuberculosis have dropped more steeply in Rwanda than just about anywhere, ever,” said Farmer. Perhaps the most renowned name healthcare delivery to the world's poor and marginalized, Farmer says he can think of no more dramatic example of turnaround.

“Pleasantly Easy”: Discourses of the Suffering Child in Rwanda Postgenocide,"“For me, it was strange to see the children drop without a sound. It was almost pleasantly easy. . . . Now too often, I am seized by the memory of those children shot straight out, like a joke.”1 It is with these words that convicted Rwandan killer Adalbert Muzingura remembers his first kills of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. He is surprised by the pleasant, almost playful, ease of killing with a gun rather than slaughtering with a machete; now, post facto, he claims to feel regret when remembering the fate of these child victims. Unlike Adalbert, I am ashamed to confess that I was not “seized” by this image of child victims, nor did I find it “strange” that dying children would figure in the opening passages of Jean Hatzfeld’s seminal collection of interviews with genocidal perpetrators, Machete Season: The Killers of Rwanda Speak.2 As a scholar of postcolonial literatures and human rights in the humanities, I am perhaps desensitized by the oversaturation of sentimentalized and sensationalized images of suffering children; perhaps, like many, I experience compassion fatigue or, as I prefer to term it, “compassion avoidance,” exhibiting symptoms of indifference and skepticism.3 In media and literary representations, it is certainly convenient and even, “almost pleasantly easy,” to draw on the figure of the suffering child to evoke emotions and, in so doing, also invoke ethical responses, be they charitable donations, humanitarian appeals, or rights claims. In this article, however, I seek to move beyond this pleasant ease, so as to delve into the problematic discourse circumscribing the figure of [End Page 27] the suffering child, by examining its possibilities and limitations, specifically as related to my current work on postgenocide Rwanda.

For a long time, I did not take the representation of the suffering child seriously enough. Rather, I considered it to be somewhat axiomatic that the suffering child figured at the apex of the hierarchy of victimization, there being so many compelling reasons to draw on this figure to elicit caring, sympathy, or advocacy. From a biological perspective, caring for human offspring, be they weak or wounded, represents a key evolutionary strategy that enabled our species to develop.4 From a representational and ethical perspective, children have long been considered “ideal victims,” to cite Nils Christie’s celebrated stereotype or to echo Aristotle’s venerable formulation of pathos as pity.5 Drawing on Aristotle, it may be argued that children are usually blameless for the wrongs perpetrated against them, weak in relation to their offender or circumstances, and in no way threatening to dominant, countervailing vested interests in status, power, and influence. Child victims thus elicit much more sympathy than adult victims and make the wrongs perpetrated against them seem even more grievous. The observer’s response to child victims—ranging from pity to righteous indignation—therefore seems morally and politically uncomplicated. After all, children are in no way responsible for starting wars or for the atrocities perpetrated against them. Thus, when considering abuses against children, observers can easily dismiss thorny political or historic-cultural concerns and instead readily occupy a superior position of judging and caring for a disenfranchised, albeit sentimentalized and infantilized, other. From this comfortable position—one that is emotionally and morally satisfying, to allude to Karen Lury—it is relatively easy to develop some form of propaedeutic ethics or politics.6 To quote Jyotsna Kapur, “Fighting for children can provide a vantage point from which we can develop a politics that guides how we live and what we live for.”7",https://muse.jhu.edu/article/547980/summary
DR Congo troops shoot dead Rwandan warlord Mudacumura,"Kinshasa, DR Congo | AFP | A Rwandan Hutu rebel leader wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crime charges has been shot dead by the Congolese army, a DRC military spokesperson said on Wednesday.

Sylvestre Mudacumura, commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), was “definitively neutralised” in DRC’s North Kivu province on Tuesday night, General Leon-Richard Kasonga said.

Mudacumura, wanted for charges including rape, torture and pillage, was killed about 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the capital of the province Goma.

The FDLR was created by Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern DRC after the genocide of Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighbouring Rwanda in 1994.

Its fighters are scattered across the eastern Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu as well as in northern Katanga.

The FDLR, opposed to the current Rwandan government, has not launched any large-scale offensive in Rwanda since 2001.

The group is regularly accused of committing atrocities against civilians in the zones it controls.

Outcry over zoo doesn't help gorillas,"Outcry over zoo doesn't help gorillas

Marguerite S. Shaffer is a professor of environmental history at Miami University in Oxford and author of “Digit’s Legacy: Reconsidering the Human-Nature Encounter in a Global World,” in ""Rendering Nature: Animals, Bodies, Places, Politics"" (2015).

For the past 10 days, the media has been gripped by the tragic death of Harambe, a western lowland gorilla from the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. Video footage of a 3-year-old boy who fell into the Gorilla World exhibit and the decision to shoot the gorilla to rescue the child sparked a media spectacle that has rivaled the drama of the current presidential race. The reopening of the Gorilla World exhibit and the decision not to prosecute the mother, promises to trigger a new wave of scrutiny.

This is not the first tragic gorilla death to capture public attention. On Feb. 3, 1978, Walter Cronkite led the ""CBS Evening News"" with the story of the murder of the mountain gorilla Digit by a band of poachers. One of 90 gorillas at the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda studied by primatologist Dian Fossey, Digit was famous for his 1975 role in the National Geographic film about Fossey’s work to save endangered mountain gorillas from the brink of extinction. Digit’s death provoked an outpouring of concern. As conservationists Bill Weber and Amy Vedder remember in their memoir, ""In the Kingdom of Gorillas,"" “Few in the listening audience knew anything about Rwanda or its people, but millions had seen Digit reach out to touch Dian Fossey in a recent National Geographic film special. For them this was almost like a death in their extended family.”

Digit’s death and the public response catalyzed a transnational conservation movement to protect mountain gorillas. Dian Fossey established the Digit Fund, now known as the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, which continues to be highly successful in supporting research, education and conservation of mountain gorillas and their habitat. Also responding to Digit’s death, Weber and Vedder established the Mountain Gorilla Project, an ecotourism and education program that promotes greater awareness of the plight of the mountain gorilla through gorilla trekking. The World Wildlife Fund, the National Geographic Society, the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation and the International Primate League all worked to raise awareness and funds to support conservation in honor of Digit. The result is a powerful legacy that has not only revitalized the mountain gorilla population in Rwanda, but also supported long-lasting community development, economic growth and the conservation of rainforest habitat in the Virunga Mountains of central Africa.

Sadly, the response to Harambe’s death has been more fraught. Villainizing the poachers who killed Digit is understandable; blaming the zoo staff and gorilla handlers who cared for Harambe is more problematic. Protesters have picketed the zoo for days. Animal rights activists have called for legal action against the Cincinnati Zoo and the mother of the child. The director of the zoo, Thane Maynard, and the board of trustees have received a barrage of hate mail. One group is demanding the closure of the Gorilla World exhibit; some have questioned the ethics of zoos and keeping animals in captivity.

The powerful movement to support wildlife conservation that followed Digit’s death is missing in the current public outcry over Harambe. That is a loss. Just like Digit, Harambe played a critical role in gorilla research and conservation efforts. Yet, instead of focusing on the loss to conservation, commentators and critics have pilloried the zoo, zoo staff and the gorilla handlers. What is missing is a thoughtful acknowledgement of the critical role zoos play not just in supporting research and wildlife conservation, but also in offering widespread education about environmental issues, and in promoting community and economic development for the cities and regions that host them. As we witness the 6th great extinction, with 7.4 billion people pushing the planetary boundaries of the environmental systems that support all life on Earth, it is clear that the plight of humans and wildlife are intricately intertwined. Rather than second-guessing the Cincinnati Zoo, we need to stand together to honor Harambe’s death so that it can serve as an opportunity for greater awareness of and dedication to critical issues of conservation. Let Digit’s legacy be a model to create a lasting and positive legacy for Harambe and the important work the zoo does for our city.",https://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/06/09/outcry-over-zoo-doesnt-help-gorillas/85610128/
The New Way of War: Killing the Kids,"In 1994, on the eve of Rwanda’s genocide, Radio Mille Collines, in Kigali, incited listeners with a venomous message: “To kill the big rats, you have to kill the little rats.” It was a veiled command to murder the youngest generation of Tutsis, the country’s minority tribe. In less than four months, an estimated three hundred thousand children were slashed, hacked, gunned, or burned to death, according to the United Nations. Among the dead were newborns.

The Rwandan slaughter was not unique. The specific targeting of children is one of the grimmest new developments in the way conflicts have been waged over the past fifty years. In the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries, roughly half of all deaths in conflict zones were civilian, according to the U.N. During the Second World War, civilians accounted for two-thirds of the fatalities. By the twentieth century’s end, almost ninety per cent were civilian.

Children have accounted for increasingly large chunks of those deaths. In 1995, UNICEF reported that roughly two million kids had been killed in wars over the previous decade—more children than soldiers. “Children are not just getting caught in the crossfire, they are also likely to be specific targets,” Graça Machel, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative, declared in the first U.N. “Children in War” report, in 1996. She went on:

When ethnic loyalties prevail, a perilous logic clicks in. The escalation from ethnic superiority to ethnic cleansing to genocide, as we have seen, can become an irresistible process. Killing adults is then not enough; future generations of the enemy—their children—must also be eliminated.

In the twenty-first century, the escalating dangers to children in conflict zones are often overlooked amid the terrible dramas of individual loss, such as the recent killing of three Israeli teen-agers and a young Palestinian. But the worldwide numbers are unprecedented. “We’re seeing everywhere that violence against children is an epidemic, amplified in conflict situations,” Susan Bissell, UNICEF’s chief of child protection, told me this week. “One billion children are today living in countries and territories affected by war or conflict—and it’s fair to conclude that large numbers suffer violent injuries and death.”

According to the Secretary-General’s latest “Children and Armed Conflict” report, issued on Tuesday, one of the most dangerous places to be a child is Syria. To take a single example: in the spring of 2011, Hamza al-Khateeb, a pudgy thirteen-year-old, got separated from his parents during a protest against the government of Bashar al-Assad. His mutilated corpse—with gunshot wounds, cigarette burns, a shattered jaw and kneecaps, and a severed penis—was returned to the family a month later. A government medical examiner reportedly claimed that the boy had been shot during the protest, and that the disfigurement was either normal decay or faked. Pictures of the body circulated on the Internet and in Syrian media, perhaps as a warning to dissidents and parents.

Since then, at least eleven thousand Syrian children—and probably thousands more—are estimated to have died in the vicious civil war. Almost eight hundred were summarily executed, with dozens killed by chemical weapons, according to the Oxford Research Group. One of the most memorable pictures from the Syrian regime’s use of sarin nerve gas last August was the long row of little corpses, wrapped in white shrouds that exposed innocent faces, as they awaited burial.

Other kids have become collateral for combatants. As Israel searched for the three abducted teenagers, UNICEF issued a statement of “grave concern” about the May 29th kidnapping of a hundred and forty Kurdish schoolboys in northern Syria. As they were returning to their hometown from junior-high-school exams in Aleppo, they were seized and taken hostage by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Four managed to escape; the rest are still missing.

Technology, ranging from nuclear weapons to small cluster bombs, has made non-combatants, especially the young, particularly vulnerable. I lived in Lebanon during its civil war. After the Israeli invasion in the nineteen-eighties, dozens of Lebanese kids were killed by cluster bombs, either in direct hits or by stepping on them or after mistaking them for toys.

When it comes to the use of insidious weaponry, nearly all sides have something to answer for. In Afghanistan, at least thirty-five thousand children have been victims of land mines since 1979, according to the U.N. Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict. When I visited the orphanage in Kabul in 1999, during the Taliban’s rule, a turbaned official lamented losing orphans who wandered into neighborhoods where land mines or explosives had been deposited by assorted domestic and foreign militaries over the previous two decades. Fifteen years later, Afghan children are still dying from the weaponry of conflicts both old and new.

Death tolls for kids are sometimes fuzzy and often not final, even long after wars end. In Bosnia, more than a thousand children are reportedly missing from a war that ended a generation ago. Aid groups also point out that politicians, militias, and interest groups exploit child deaths—both their numbers and circumstances—for propaganda value, a recurrent controversy in counting the death toll in Iraq’s various conflicts.

Regardless of public revulsion, U.N. officials told me this week, the rising number of child casualties is unlikely to subside anytime soon. Today’s wars are increasingly within countries rather than between them; the fighting has moved to city streets, invading the playrooms of homes and kindergartens.

"Twenty years after genocide, Rwanda is a model of health equity","One of the most horrific tales of mass violence ever began just 20 years ago. During the 100 days after Easter 1994, ethnic Hutu extremists killed 1 million fellow Rwandans. The surviving 80% of the population reeled from health crises.

Health workers fled or were killed. Many who remained had been complicit in the genocide, seeding distrust in medical establishment. An estimated 250,000 women were raped. HIV became a weapon of war. Refugee camps fell to one of the century’s largest cholera outbreaks. Rwanda was left with the world’s highest child mortality and lowest life expectancy at birth. Fewer than one in four children were vaccinated against measles and polio.

“Whether survivor, perpetrator, or member of the diaspora, no Rwandan emerged unaffected,” writes Rwandan minister of health Agnes Binagwaho in The Lancet on Apr.4 , in a study co-authored with Dr. Paul Farmer and a team of international public health experts. “Much of the rest of the world stood idly by.”

Few imagined that Rwanda, a country the size of Maryland, would so soon—if ever—serve as an international model for health equity.

Just two decades later, that life expectancy has doubled. Vaccination rates for many diseases are now higher than those registered in the United States—more than 97% of Rwandan infants are immunized against ten different diseases. Child mortality has fallen by more than two thirds since 2000. New HIV infection rates fell by 60% between 2000 and 2012, and AIDS-related mortality fell by 82%. HIV treatment is free.

“In the last decade, death rates from AIDS and tuberculosis have dropped more steeply in Rwanda than just about anywhere, ever,” said Farmer. Perhaps the most renowned name healthcare delivery to the world’s poor and marginalized, Farmer says he can think of no more dramatic example of turnaround.

“Some assume that such awful circumstances led to a tardy but emphatic humanitarian response,” Binagwaho and colleagues write today. “Such assumptions are wrong. Many were ready to write Rwanda off as a lost cause.” In 1995, Rwandans received an average of 50 cents per person in foreign assistance for health. Only a decade ago did Rwanda receive its first major international grants to treat HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.

“Some development experts even advised withholding primary care services from children to stave off population growth and prevent what they called a ‘Malthusian abyss,’” the Lancet authors write.

The unlikely success hinged on a national development plan that championed health equity, a constitution that formally named a universal right to health, a community-based national health insurance system, and community health workers. (In each of Rwanda’s 14,837 villages, three elected community health workers are trained and equipped to disseminate resources and basic elements of care.)

In 1998, a new government launched a consultative process to create a national development plan based on inclusive social cohesion and health equity, involving substantial investments in public health and healthcare delivery. Community-based health insurance and performance-based financing systems began in three of the country’s districts and expanded nationwide in 2004.

In 2010 the Ministry of Health instituted a three-tiered premium system based on Rwanda’s socioeconomic assessment system, ubudehe. There was simultaneous decentralization and integration of health services, increasing domestic funding alongside external resources. By 2010, 58% of foreign assistance was able to be channeled through Rwandan national systems, compared with an average of 20% in post-conflict settings.

“This strengthening of public sector capacity is both cause and effect of a focus on national ownership and oversight,” Binagwaho and colleagues write. “Such an approach to shared accountability has also leveraged increasing investment from the Rwandan government.” Rwanda was able to dedicate 22% of general government expenditure to public health in 2011, for services like gender-based violence prevention and family planning.

“Counter to some experts’ forecasts after the genocide, reduced child mortality has correlated closely with higher family planning uptake. More children surviving means parents no longer have additional children to offset the expected deaths of some.”

Addressing the Use of Sexual Violence as a Strategic Weapon of War,"Abstract This paper examines historical and contemporary instances wherein sexual violence, specifically rape, was used as a strategic weapon amid both traditional and tribal conflict, as well as in genocidal operations. It analyzes the cogency of sexual violence as a weapon by considering its physical and psychological effects on victims and the morale of targeted populations. Additionally, it scrutinizes the motivations and intentions that support the use of sexual violence during armed conflict in order to ascertain potential methods by which the incentive may be removed or mediated. The intent of this paper is to identify the use of rape in warfare as a crime against humanity. Accordingly, it presents applicable international laws that may be cited in the adjudication of rape warfare practitioners and suggests prosecution is the duty of the international community. It introduces specific examples of the effective enforcement of these laws as well as criticisms presented by victims’ advocates. Additionally, it proposes a humanitarian aid response that addresses the social damage which wartime sexual violence creates. This paper thus offers a two-pronged approach to the problem of wartime sexual violence: one of calculated judicial application and compassionate people-centered assistance.

Sexual violence has been employed as a strategic weapon of war for at least as long as historians have been documenting conflicts. Indeed, members of nearly every standing army in history have participated in some form of rape warfare (Vikman, 2005). Consequently, the international community has implemented various forms of legislation to criminalize the deliberate targeting of civilians during armed conflict (Bergoffen, 2006; Haddad, 2011). Nonetheless, rape remains one of the most under-reported and inadequately prosecuted of all war crimes (Falcon, 2001). Certainly, a lack of discipline exhibited by inexperienced and non-professional warriors in conflicts can explain a fraction of these occurrences. Though, it would be disingenuous to affix such justifications upon those instances that are deliberately calculated by the professional warfighters and commanders of comparably advanced armies (Valenius, 2004). Moreover, the sheer prevalence of its use precludes the validity of the “bad apple” argument, wherein a deviant minority becomes the scapegoat which suffers for the sins of an apathetic organization (Whitmer, 2006). Indeed, sexual deprivation and base desire cannot explain why even educated military strategists would advocate the use of sexual violence in warfare. Unless, on the other hand, they regard it as an valuable weapon to strategically target the psychological well-being and social cohesion of civilian populations as well as the morale of enemy units (Clifford, 2008).

The History and State of Rape Warfare

In order to address the resultant social problems associated with sexual violence in conflict, it is necessary to understand the motivations and intent behind the groups that have sanctioned its use. Those who have used rape as a weapon perceive it to be an effective complimentary method by which their goals can be achieved and are drawn to its symbolic message of dominance (Baaz & Stern, 2009). Accordingly, those who wish to remedy its negative consequences and mediate future occurrences must understand why it works in the first instance (Mukamana & Brysiewicz, 2008). Most importantly, careful study of the underlying justifications for its use may reveal avenues by which these motivations can be arrested or removed (Dwyer, 2009). If such inclinations cannot be combatted, viable deterrence measures may be implemented which will raise the cost to the perpetrators of rape warfare beyond its potential benefit to their cause (Castillo, 2007). Recent landmark rulings represent small steps toward resolution via the adjudication of wartime rapists. Regardless, victims’ advocates remain largely unimpressed; many having become even more vocal in their demands for justice (Bergoffen, 2006; Hargreaves, 2001). Therefore, the need for a victim-focused humanitarian response is axiomatic. Even when copiously applied, the law alone cannot cure the social plights which disproportionately affect women and children in the wake of wartime atrocity (Ghobarah, Huth, & Russett, 2003).

The prevalence of sexual violence in warfare is well documented and permeates world history. According to Gottschall (2004), its use was illustrated in ancient texts such as Homer’s Iliad and the Old Testament of the Holy Bible (e.g. Zechariah 14:2). In the 13th Century, Genghis Khan established specific policies which encouraged the use of rape warfare as he expanded his empire. Khan infamously proclaimed that one of the greatest pleasures in life was to ravage the daughters and wives of one’s enemies (Clifford, 2008). Rape was later employed as a strategic weapon by members of both the Allied and Axis armies during World War II as a means to terrorize civilian populations and demoralize their respective enemies (Epp, 1997; Ferraro, 2008). The most atrocious example within this era was the infamous Japanese campaign which became known as the Rape of Nanking. After killing about half of the city’s approximated 600,000 residents, Japanese Imperial Army soldiers gang-raped between 20,000 and 80,000 Chinese females of various ages (Sedgwick, 2009). Therein, fathers were forced to rape their daughters and sons their mothers, generally under threat of death, while other family members watched (Zimbardo, 2007, pp.16-17). Ostensibly, this was a calculated employment of psychological warfare aimed at reducing the cohesion of family units and the community as a whole so that Japanese authority would not be resisted (MacDonald, 2005; Sedgwick, 2009).

More recently, sexual violence has become a component of civil warfare in developing nations such as Afghanistan and Guatemala, as well as amid the purported 400,000 deaths associated with state-sponsored genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan (Hagan, Rymond-Richmond, & Parker, 2005). Though rape warfare has endured into the modern era, sexual violence is still perceived by many to be an inherent byproduct of war itself; influenced by such factors as the sexual deprivation of mobilized troops, a lack of military discipline, and the biological drive to produce offspring (Clifford, 2008; Thornhill & Palmer, 2000; Vandermassen, 2011). This indifference only perpetuates its use and lessens the likelihood that perpetrators will face justice for their transgressions. Moreover, such callous assertions are void of empirical evidence and cannot explain the rampant and coordinated use of sexual violence (Buss, 2009; Clifford, 2008). Rape warfare is as old as written human history, having been employed by uneducated tribesman and military tacticians alike (Clifford, 2008; Gottschall, 2004). However, advancements in military technology seem to have replaced or improved upon virtually every aspect of armed conflict, save for two of man’s baser desires; sex and violence.

The Efficacy of Sexual Violence as a Weapon

Sexual violence is and has been a common thread in modern conflicts and genocidal operations around the world (Clifford, 2008). Two contemporary examples of the state-sponsored coordinated use of rape warfare were perpetrated against “out groups” of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992-95 and of Rwanda in the spring of 1994 (Haddad, 2011; Staub, 1999; Weitsman, 2008). In addition to being a psychological weapon, rape warfare was used therein with the deliberate intention of significantly diminishing particular ethnic populations. In both instances, governmental approval offered a license for sadistic innovation against the targeted populations (Jamieson, 1999). Such was the nature of its employment during a tribal conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi communities of Rwanda. Amid an estimated 800,000 to 1 million deaths, roughly three-quarters of the entire Tutsi population was eradicated (Leitenberg, 1994; Mukamana & Brysiewicz, 2008). This state-sponsored genocide operation armed the Hutu populations and encouraged them to use rape as a tactic of terror and spiritual annihilation. One Hutu leader, Mayor Silvester Cacumbibi, is rumored to have told one of his victims “We won’t waste bullets on you; we will rape you and that will be worse for you” (Zimbardo, 2007, p. 13).

One of the largest mass rape-murders of a Tutsi population during this conflict was orchestrated by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, a former social worker, minister, and lecturer on female empowerment who was herself a Tutsi (Hogg, 2010). Therein, Nyiramasuhuko created a ruse wherein she convinced the Tutsi people within the village of Butare to gather for a humanitarian aid drop, whereupon they were cut down by automatic weapons, grenades, and machetes. She ordered the Hutu aggressors to rape all of the women before killing them (Durkham & O’Byrne, 2010; Zimbardo, 2007, p. 13). When the men became fatigued, she provided gasoline from her own vehicle so that the remaining women could be burned to death. One young Tutsi woman, Rose, was raped by Nyiramasuhuko’s son who had received “permission” from his mother. After being forced to watch the rape of her own mother and the murders of several of her relatives, Rose was allowed to live so that she could “deliver a progress report” as a witness to the massacre (Zimbardo, 2007, p. 13). Incidents such as this were not uncommon during the Rwandan tribal conflict. Researchers estimate that approximately 350,000 Tutsi females were raped within this three-month period (Bijleveld, Morssinkhof, & Smeulers, 2009). Military strategists may regard this activity as a waste of valuable resources and manpower. Moreover, troops would be potentially exposing themselves to venereal diseases while commanders run the risk of losing control of their men, making their units combat ineffective (Donovan, 2002; Meini, 2008). However, the Hutu leaders and sponsoring government understood the power of the message. To them, it was not counter-productive to kill women immediately after they were raped, so long as a select few lived to tell the story; women like Rose. Therefore, rape warfare exemplifies intimidation in its most malevolent form (Parfitt, 2004).

The efficacy of rape warfare has been substantiated through its implementation as a weapon by which warring factions have facilitated their goals (Clifford, 2008). However, the same could be said of concentration camps and the mass exterminations organized by the Nazi Party during the Second World War. One notable difference therein is that many of the perpetrators of the Holocaust were adjudicated at the Nuremberg Trials (Hoffman, 1999). Contrarily, those who have sanctioned and committed rape warfare have historically evaded justice (Falcon, 2001). For example, following a 36-year civil war in Guatemala, rape victims and their families maintained that absolute blame rested upon the state-sponsored soldiers who had perpetuated the barbarity. Nonetheless, they believed that their only available recourse was through legitimate state agents, whose power rivaled or superseded that of the offenders. Paradoxically, their demands for justice could only be heard by members of the same government that had initially mobilized the soldier-rapists (Hastings, 2002; Ross, 2004).

Similarly, sexual violence amid armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been labeled by the United Nations (UN) as a strategic weapon of war and a gross violation of human rights. Regardless, and in spite of the Goma peace agreement, the atrocities persisted unabated. Both state and non-state armed groups have been identified as perpetrators of rape warfare by the UN and declared to be in violation of various international laws, to include the Nuremberg Code. Nonetheless, the study of mass rape during armed conflict is largely done retrospectively, with significant intervention rarely taking place (Maedl, 2011). These contemporary examples demonstrate that the perpetrators of rape warfare are largely immune from judicial proceedings. Indeed, even when an international body as powerful as the UN condemns their actions, offenders can be reasonably certain that they will never answer for their transgressions, which only buttresses their perceived entitlement to the “spoils” of war (Falcon, 2001; Mukamana & Brysiewicz, 2008). In the absence of cogent deterrence measures, rape warfare has become an omnipresent consequence of armed conflict (Clifford, 2008).

Injustice and Underreporting

Among many populations, rape is the most underreported of all violent crimes, even during peacetime (Clay-Warner & McMahon-Howard, 2009; Falcon, 2001). Many rapes are not reported due to the victims’ lack of understanding of what legally constitutes a sexual assault. Therein, ignorance of the law breeds trepidation. Moreover, survivors often perceive that they will be somehow further victimized by law enforcement personnel or the judicial system (Clay-Warner & McMahon-Howard, 2009). This preconception has been reinforced by numerous historical examples and will require significant action to remedy. Additionally, victims often feel embarrassed and wish to keep the incidents private as they question their own culpability (Clay-Warner & McMahon-Howard, 2009; S. Holmes & R. Holmes, 2009, pp. 218-219). In roughly 10 percent of cases, this embarrassment eventually manifests as shame, largely due to fear of public scrutiny and cultural ideologies which tend to at least partially blame the victim for the assault (Weiss, 2010). Victims must first understand that they have suffered from a crime that is punishable by law and that the perpetrators bear the full burden of guilt. More importantly, they must have access to justice (Allen, 2007). Ergo, an effective counter strategy must incorporate the application of human-rights law and humanitarian advocacy.Continued on Next Page »",http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/732/addressing-the-use-of-sexual-violence-as-a-strategic-weapon-of-war
The Media as a Tool of War: Propaganda in the Rwandan Genocide,"By Matthew Lower and Thomas Hauschildt.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the beginning of the Rwandan genocide. From April to July 1994, over 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. In addition, 250,000 women became victims of sexual violence, many of whom were killed afterwards.[i] An estimated 70 percent of the women who survived were infected with HIV. At the end of the 100 days of slaughter, 85 percent of Tutsis – equal to 10 percent of Rwanda’s population – were killed and half of the population was either internally displaced or had fled the country.

The Rwandan genocide serves as a stark reminder how little the international community has learnt from the horrors of the Holocaust; in view of not only the vast crimes committed, but the abject inaction to prevent a genocide which had “one of the highest casualty rates of any population in history from non-natural causes.”[ii]

A plethora of factors were responsible for the genocide. Some of these can be dated back to over a century ago, when colonial powers entrenched a division between Hutus and Tutsis, a division further exacerbated in the decades that were to follow. Though the genocide was planned by the ‘Hutu Power’ Government and executed by the military and armed militia groups, a large number of civilians were actively involved in the atrocities. Neighbours turned against neighbours, friends against friends and even relatives against relatives. Most of the victims were killed with elementary weapons such as machetes, clubs and axes and it is estimated that 130,000 people took actively part in the killings.[iii]

The obvious question, then, is how such a high number of seemingly ordinary people could become ruthless murderers and commit crimes which shock the human conscience?

Constructing a Rhetoric of “Us” versus “Them”

Rwanda was colonized by Germany in 1897 before Belgium took over control in 1916. In colonial administration, Europeans generally considered Tutsis as a superior group, and thus collaborated with the Tutsi monarchy to rule Rwanda. Where being Tutsi was commonly equated with a life of superiority and domination, being a Hutu was associated with a life of inferiority and subordination. Tutsis were predominantly herdsmen, whilst the majority of Hutus were farmers. Although being often described as ‘ethnic’ groups, Hutus and Tutsis differed in occupation rather than in terms of ethnic attributes.

Indeed, Tutsis and Hutus are often described as belonging to the same ethnic groups as they share language, culture and region. Moreover, intermarriage was not uncommon and social mobility between Hutus and Tutsis was possible. Hutus acquiring larger amounts of cattle could become Tutsis, whereas Tutsis with a decreasing number of cattle could become Hutus.

Despite these assertions, the conflict is commonly portrayed as an ethnic conflict, where group identities were artificially entrenched by colonial powers. The identities of Hutus and Tutsis were further constructed and reinforced by Belgian colonialists when they introduced identity cards in 1933, assigning the ethnicity of Hutu, Tutsi or Twa to each Rwandan. A formerly ranked, but flexible system (which offered some level of social mobility), became a rigid system divided by largely-artificial ethnic delineation. Of crucial importance, following Rwanda’s independence in 1962, the Hutu government maintained the colonial policy of identity cards, espoused anti-Tutsi propaganda and continued the keeping of ethnic quotas. This historical context is highly relevant, as much of the propaganda surrounding the genocide drew upon the distinctions and policies implemented during colonial rule.

The perception of “us” versus “them” was transmitted through generations and became institutionalised. Solutions suggested by one group to resolve mounting tension were considered by the other side as a way for “them” to gain more power over “us”. In the decades to follow, these perspectives, strongly influenced by the colonial period, became reinforced and deeply entrenched in the fabric of Rwandan society. The seed for protracted social conflict, leading to the eventual genocide, was sown and the Rwandan media was well aware of how to use it to its advantage.

Exploiting Division With Hate Speech Propaganda

Generally, group formation, per se, is not the source of conflict, but conflict is likely to arise if distinct groups are extremely exclusive and group members perceive their security to be under threat. This was to become evident in Rwanda by the early 1990s.

In the years following independence, thousands of Tutsis fled from violence directed against them. By the late 1980s, Tutsis living in exile in Uganda formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Its military arm, the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), invaded northern Rwanda in late 1990 and a four year insurgency campaign followed.

The advance of the RPA led to extensive propaganda campaigns of the Rwandan media, exaggerating perceived differences between Tutsi and Hutu. The media draw attention to the colonial period and spread fears that Hutus could once more be the victim of suppression if Tutsis were to take over control in Rwanda. These assertions were supported by coordinated public acts intended to increase the levels of fear among the public, such as a staged attack on Kigali by ‘Tutsis’ in October 1990.

Robert Guest[iv] argues that propaganda was “swallowed” by Hutu peasants, who began to identify as Hutu and not Rwandan. This contributed to a post-colonial precedent of anti-Tutsi propaganda, which was already a feature in massacres in 1959, 1962 and 1972. The 1990 invasion of Rwanda by the RPF escalated this trend, and was perceived to have ‘legitimised’ anti-Tutsi propaganda that targeted both the RPF and domestic Tutsis. Both RTLM and Kangura argued anyone who opposed the Hutu Power movement was a Tutsi ‘accomplice’ and RPF ally.[v]

Comparisons can be drawn with theories on war propaganda, particularly the common emphasis on the ‘traitor within’[vi]. War propaganda is often labelled as ‘news’, manipulated to further separate agendas[vii]. This was certainly true in Rwanda, where government propaganda claimed the invading RPF intended to massacre the Hutu population. A prominent example of this manipulation was a widely distributed 1992 military document, which identified ‘the enemy’ as Tutsis inside and outside the country.[viii] Utilising the resultant fears to raise ethnic tensions, extremist Hutu officials commonly encouraged retaliatory massacres against Tutsis following RPF attacks.

Following the RPF invasion, media outlets such as the newspaper ‘Kangura’, ‘Radio Rwanda‘ and in 1993 ‘Radio Mille Collines‘ (RTLM), became tools of mass propaganda. These media sources portrayed extreme ethnic distinctions, defining Tutsis as ‘the enemy’ and Kangura published the infamous Hutu ‘Ten Commandments’, a widely circulated, militant ‘Hutu Power’ doctrine. Sometimes popular music was mixed with incitement to murder. Propaganda fuelled hysterical fear of Tutsis and blurred the line between the RPF and domestic Tutsis. Consequently, Tutsis in general were identified as an ‘invading force’ and in emphasising the ‘alienness’, cleverness and deceitfulness of Tutsis, propaganda established them as a ‘permanent threat’.[ix] A lack of alternative media sources in Rwanda contributed to the attention these outlets received.

What made propaganda particularly effective was the simultaneous dehumanisation of Tutsi and the legitimisation of their extermination. The ‘Ten Commandments’ had revived historically divisive ethnic myths, whilst Kangura and RTLM referred to Tutsis as Inyenzi (cockroaches), creating a dehumanising discourse. The emphasis on ‘inherent’ differences was crucial in presenting the ‘risk’ posed by Tutsis. Similarities have been drawn between anti-Tutsi propaganda and the Nazi’s portrayal of Jews, as well as propaganda in the former Yugoslavia, where the media also successfully fostered deep ethnic divisions.

In 1993 the RPF and the then-Rwandan Government under Habyarimana signed a peace agreement – the Arusha Accords – leading to a power-sharing agreement. The agreement was overseen by the United Nations Mission Assistance (UNAMIR). However, amongst (and contributing to) other factors, propaganda played a significant role in undermining the Arusha Accords, sustaining the conflict and rationale of the extremist propaganda. Furthermore, media targeted the United Nations presence and moderate Hutus were labelled as traitorous divisionists, publicly targeting individuals such as the Prime Minister.

Such societal cleavages were a clear contributor to the 1994 atrocities, whereby Hutu extremists had successfully ‘fostered the radicalization of prejudice.’[x]

Turning Hatred into Genocide

Whilst these examples of propaganda, and their influence on 1994 Rwanda, were delivered by various sources, the simultaneous development of the Interahamwe militia, arms caches and extremist propaganda demonstrate evidence of central coordination. In a broadcast on 3rd April 1994, RTLM alluded to knowledge of the impending atrocities.[xi] Prior to the genocide, propaganda was clearly utilised to create conditions would facilitate subsequent mass killings of Tutsis.

On the 6th April 1994, Habyarimana’s plane was shot down. The genocide started a few hours later. The ‘Hutu Power’ media played an immediate and pivotal role in spurring on the genocide as it occurred. RTLM in particular became an active organiser of the genocide, immediately blaming the RPF following President Habyarimana’s assassination and organising violence against Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

RTLM subsequently took on a role described my McNulty[xii] as the ‘facilitator of genocide’. From the beginning it broadcast the names of ‘targets’ and reported the locations of victims hiding from the militias, as did Radio Rwanda. Propaganda created a sense of ‘urgency’, compelling Hutus to act quickly in response to the perceived ‘danger’. As a result of radio propaganda’s role, Samantha Power stated that “Killers often carried a machete in one hand and a transistor radio in the other.”[xiii]

RTLM broadcast fearmongering misinformation regarding the RPF throughout the genocide, to maintain the climate of fear. RTLM attempted to justify killings, framing them as Hutu self-defence, stating ‘the cruelty of the Inyenzi can only be cured by their total extermination.’[xiv] An influential analysis of the Genocide by Article 19, argued that RTLM had become a clear tool in the genocide’s execution.[xv] Above all, Jones identified that propaganda was a vital cornerstone in biding the Hutu majority “in genocidal complicity”.[xvi]

Clear parallels between RTLM’s disinformation during the genocide with other propaganda campaigns are evident, Hintjens[xvii] refers in one instance to an almost exact replica of a story used by WW2 partisans in Poland. The RTLM’s calls for the final extermination of Tutsis indeed bears clear resemblance to the ‘final solution’ advocated by Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels. In the proceedings of the subsequent International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), the prosecution argued “What RTLM did was to spread petrol through the country little by little, so that one day it would be to set fire to the whole country.”[xviii]

The use of propaganda leaflets and radio messages was a key tool in procuring the compliance of Hutus to participate in the massacres, including those initially against the killings. Propaganda alluded to the rewards participants would receive for killing Tutsis. These messages reinforced impunity and provided the killers with the legitimacy to kill Tutsis and the moderate Hutus who often tried to protect them. Those Hutus who fled Rwanda after the genocide were often pushed into doing so by fear filled propaganda, which was arguably aimed at increasing the number of refugees, who would then be seen as victims by the international community.

Strikingly, whilst Burundi’s Hutu President was also killed, the Burundi media worked with the UN and domestic officials to broadcast a message of calm, averting atrocities on this occasion. This emphasises propaganda’s influence in spurring on the Rwandan genocide.

The effects of the propaganda also transcended from the national to the international sphere, as Hutu propaganda arguably misled the international community’s perceptions of the genocide. Propaganda alluded to atrocities committed by the RPF which in turn contributed to notions that atrocities were the result of renewed warfare, ethnic tensions or simply ‘chaos’. Indeed, French media portrayed the events as a “two way genocide” and French troops were led to believe Hutus were victims of the conflict.[xix]

Nonetheless, international actors became fully aware of the true role Hutu-Power propaganda was playing and the Force Commander of UNAMIR, General Roméo Dallaire, head of the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda, requested the use of jamming equipment.[xx] Former state department official, and now United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, has vocally argued since the genocide that the US in particular could and should have done so, asserting that in ending the “crucial, deadly radio broadcasts” with jamming equipment, it may have at least slowed the genocide and potentially saved thousands of lives.[xxi] In a blunt addressal of the jamming debate, the BBC stated:

‘Simply jamming [the] broadcasts and replacing them with messages of peace and reconciliation would have had a significant impact on the course of events.”[xxii]

In demonstrating the now-consensus on propagandas role in the genocide, RTML’s most vocal leaders during the genocide, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, Ferdinand Nahimana and Hasson Ngeze, were indicted, arrested and tried by the ICTR. Barayagwiza and Ngeze received a sentence of 35 years, Nahimana received 30 years. The ICTR concluded that the defendants were:

“Guilty of conspiracy to commit genocide, genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide and persecution and. exterminations as crimes against humanity”’[xxiii]

Conclusion

It is evident then, that the media was used to mobilize Hutu against Tutsi in an organised, coordinated campaign by Hutu-Power extremists. Tension between the two groups existed for decades, but what was a protracted social conflict morphed quickly into a genocide with significant assistance from the media.

Propaganda played an active, supportive role in facilitating the atrocities, as well as an influential role in establishing the pre-conditions for mass-killings. The lessons for the international society are twofold. Whilst a free press is sine qua none to hold those in power accountable and represents the very foundation free societies rest upon, it needs to be emphasised that freedom comes with responsibility. The abuse of the freedom of speech to create division through hate speech that in turn leads to large scale violence is an indicator of an arising conflict. Such hate speech needs to identified and acted upon. Increased pressure by the international society is required to halt such speeches and resources need to pour in to solve tensions between groups.

Furthermore, the Rwandan genocide demonstrated that where propaganda and hate speech is so influential, lives can be saved if media outlets inciting violence are neutralised. Roméo Dallaire requested the jamming of radio frequencies, an action which would not only have been simple to achieve, but also effective in potentially reducing the number of casualties. Should future conflicts demonstrate similarly divisive and fearmongering disinformation, efforts should be made to both provide alternative sources of information and to block dangerous propaganda sources. The commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide should be a stark reminder that the consequences of hate speech should not be underestimated.",http://www.hscentre.org/sub-saharan-africa/media-tool-war-propaganda-rwandan-genocide/
United States Department of State,"The government occasionally took steps to prosecute or punish officials who committed abuses, including within the security services, but impunity involving civilian officials and some members of the SSF was a problem.

Human rights issues included reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings by state security forces; forced disappearance by state security forces; torture by state security forces including asphyxiation, electric shocks, mock executions; arbitrary detention by state security forces; political prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; threats to and violence against journalists, censorship, website blocking, and criminal libel; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, such as overly restrictive nongovernmental organization (NGO) laws; and restrictions on political participation.

Rwanda is a constitutional republic dominated by a strong presidency. The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) led a governing coalition that included four smaller parties. In August 2017 voters elected President Paul Kagame to a third seven-year term with a reported 99 percent of the vote and a reported 98 percent turnout. One independent candidate and one candidate from an opposition political party participated in the presidential election, but authorities disqualified three other candidates. In the September elections for parliament’s lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, candidates from the RPF coalition and two other parties that supported RPF policies won all except four of the open seats. For the first time, independent parties won seats in the chamber, with the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda (DGPR) and the Social Party Imberakuri (PS-Imberakuri) winning two seats each. In both the 2017 and the 2018 elections, international monitors reported numerous flaws, including irregularities in the vote tabulation process.

Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:

a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings There were numerous reports the government committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. For example, according to media reports, on April 13, Kigali attorney Donat Mutunzi disappeared after leaving for work. His family made repeated inquiries of police but was unable to confirm his arrest until April 18. At that time a police officer reportedly told them that Mutunzi was suspected of having defamed President Kagame by circulating false information on the internet. On April 22, prosecutors told an attorney and friend of the Mutunzi family that Mutunzi had been accused of rape. On April 23, police reported Mutunzi had committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell. An examination of the body revealed severe wounds on the face and temples. Mutunzi’s family members told human rights advocates they believed Mutunzi had been beaten and strangled while in custody. As of September 14, the government had not completed its investigation into 2017 Human Rights Watch (HRW) allegations that police or other security forces had killed 37 individuals between 2016 and 2017 for a variety of petty crimes, including theft of bananas, fishing with illegal nets, and unlawful border crossings. In 2017 Minister of Justice Johnston Busingye publicly called the HRW report “fake news.”

b. Disappearance There were several reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities. On October 7, United Democratic Forces-Inkingi (FDU-Inkingi) Vice President Boniface Twagirimana disappeared from Mpanga prison. A government spokesperson told press that Twagirimana and another prisoner had escaped by climbing over the prison wall. The FDU-Inkingi disputed this account and alleged foul play by government authorities, noting that authorities had transferred Twagirimana to Mpanga prison just five days earlier. The party released a press statement saying reliable sources inside the prison had indicated that security agents had taken Twagirimana away in a vehicle. As of November 6, Twagirimana’s whereabouts remained unknown. Domestic organizations cited a lack of capacity and independence to investigate security-sector abuses, including reported enforced disappearances.

c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment The constitution and law prohibit such practices, but there were numerous reports of abuse of detainees by police, military, and National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) officials. On September 27, the government enacted an updated penal code that prescribes 20 to 25 years’ imprisonment for any person convicted of torture. The law mandates that when torture is committed by a public official in the course of his or her duties, the penalty for conviction is life imprisonment. As of September 14, the government had not conducted an investigation into 104 cases of illegally detained individuals who were in many cases reportedly tortured in unofficial military detention centers between 2010 and 2016, as documented by a 2017 HRW report. According to the report, military intelligence personnel and army soldiers employed torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment to obtain confessions before transferring the individuals to formal detention facilities. Detainees described asphyxiation, electric shocks, mock executions, severe beatings, and other mistreatment. HRW observed the trials of multiple individuals who alleged being tortured at unofficial military detention centers, including the Kami and the Mukamira military camps; a military base known as the “Gendarmerie” in Rubavu; and detention centers in Bigogwe, Mudende, and Tumba. According to the HRW report, many of the individuals told judges they had been illegally detained and tortured, but HRW was “not aware of any judges ordering an investigation into such allegations or dismissing evidence obtained under torture.” There were no reported prosecutions of SSF personnel for torture. Prison and Detention Center Conditions Conditions at prisons and unofficial military detention centers ranged from harsh and life-threatening to meeting international standards. The government took steps to make improvements in some prisons, but conditions varied widely among facilities. Domestic civil society organizations reported impediments for persons with disabilities, including lack of sign language interpreters at police stations and detention centers. Physical Conditions : Physical conditions in prisons operated by the Rwanda Correctional Service (RCS) were generally considered adequate. There were no major concerns regarding inmate abuse. Convicted persons and individuals in pretrial detention in RCS prisons were fed once per day, and family members were allowed to deposit funds so that convicts and detainees could purchase additional food at prison canteens. Authorities held men and women separately in similar conditions, and authorities generally separated pretrial detainees from convicted prisoners, although there were numerous exceptions due to the large number of detainees awaiting trial. Overcrowding was common in police stations and detention centers, and poor ventilation often led to high temperatures. According to the RCS, the prison population rose by approximately 15 percent, from fewer than 52,000 inmates in 2015 to more than 61,000 in August, which greatly exacerbated prison overcrowding. There were reports that prison overcrowding remained an issue. In contrast, conditions were generally harsh and life threatening in unofficial military detention centers, according to a 2017 HRW report. HRW reported that in addition to experiencing torture, individuals detained at such centers suffered from limited access to food, water, and health care. Transit centers often lacked separate facilities for children. According to HRW, officials held children together with adults in the Muhanga, Mudende, and Gikondo transit centers. The law does not allow children older than age three to remain with their incarcerated mothers. The government held five prisoners of the Special Court for Sierra Leone in a purpose-built detention center that the United Nations deemed met international standards for incarceration of prisoners convicted by international criminal tribunals. Administration : The RCS investigated reported abuses by corrections officers, and the same hierarchical structure existed in police and security forces; there was no independent institution charged with investigating abuses or punishing perpetrators. Detainees held at the Iwawa Rehabilitation and Vocational Development Center did not have the right to appeal their detentions to judicial authorities. Independent Monitoring : The government permitted independent monitoring of prison conditions on a limited basis by diplomats and the International Committee of the Red Cross. At times, however, it restricted access to specific prisoners and did not permit monitors to visit undeclared detention centers and certain military intelligence facilities. The government permitted monitoring of prison conditions and trials of individuals whom the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT) had transferred to Rwandan national jurisdiction for trials related to the 1994 genocide, per agreement with the MICT. In June the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT) formally cancelled its visit to the country. In October 2017 the visit originally was suspended due to obstructions imposed by the government such as limiting access to places of detention. On June 1, the UN assistant secretary-general wrote to the government concerning the lack of assurances given to the SPT that those interviewed or contacted during the visit would not face intimidation or reprisals. Journalists could access prisons with a valid press card but required permission from the RCS commissioner to take photographs or interview prisoners or guards. Improvements : Observers credited the RCS with continuing to take steps to improve prison conditions and eradicate abuses in formal detention facilities. In July the government closed the Kigali Central “1930” Prison, the oldest prison in the country, and moved remaining prisoners to a newer facility in Mageragere. The updated penal code removed provisions allowing solitary confinement of prisoners.

d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, but SSF personnel regularly arrested and detained persons arbitrarily and without due process. The law provides for the right of persons to challenge in court the lawfulness of their arrest or detention; however, few tried, and there were no reports of any detainees succeeding in obtaining prompt release or compensation for unlawful detention. According to HRW’s October 2017 report, individuals “suspected of collaborating with enemies” were detained unlawfully and held “for up to nine months in extremely harsh and inhuman conditions,” frequently incommunicado. HRW also documented cases “in which individuals believed to be held in military custody have never returned and appear to have been forcibly disappeared.” Individuals detained by military intelligence were not registered in the formal law enforcement system, and “the period of their detention in military facilities [is] erased from public record,” according to HRW. Human rights advocates also reported that police officers killed suspects while making arrests. In May police shot and killed a motorcyclist in Kigali during a traffic stop. Eyewitnesses reported police handcuffed the motorcyclist and began kicking him when the motorcyclist argued with officers. The motorcyclist fled and was pursued by the officer, who proceeded to catch and shoot the motorcyclist. A police spokesperson told press the officer fired because the motorcyclist had attempted to seize the officer’s weapon. Human rights advocates cast doubt on the police’s version of events, noting that eyewitnesses said the motorcyclist was handcuffed and had his hands raised when he was shot. Domestic observers and local media reported the Rwanda National Police (RNP) continued the practice of systematically rounding up and arbitrarily detaining street children, street vendors, suspected drug abusers, persons in prostitution, homeless persons, and suspected petty criminals. As in previous years, the RNP held detainees without charge at the Gikondo Transit Center before either transferring them to the Iwawa Rehabilitation and Vocational Development Center without judicial review or forcibly returning them to their home areas in the countryside. ROLE OF THE POLICE AND SECURITY APPARATUS The RNP, under the Ministry of Justice, is responsible for internal security. The Rwanda Defense Force (RDF), under the Ministry of Defense, is in charge of providing external security, although the RDF also works on internal security and intelligence matters alongside the RNP. In April the recently created Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) assumed some of the functions formerly performed by the RNP, including counterterrorism investigations, investigation of economic and financial crimes, and judicial police functions. Civilian authorities generally maintained control over the RNP and the RDF, and the government had mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption. The RNP’s Inspectorate General generally disciplined police for excessive use of force and prosecuted acts of corruption, but there were some instances of impunity. There were reports SSF elements at times acted independently of civilian control. For example, there were reports RDF J-2 (intelligence staff), NISS, and RNP intelligence personnel were responsible for disappearances, illegal detention, and torture in unofficial detention centers. The RDF normally displayed a high level of military professionalism and discipline, and it took action to investigate and punish misconduct. In August an RDF soldier was immediately arrested after he shot three individuals during a dispute at a bar in Rubavu, killing one. On December 4, a military court sentenced the soldier to life in prison and fined him 6.1 million Rwandan francs ($6,930). Police at times lacked sufficient basic resources–such as handcuffs, radios, and patrol cars–but observers credited the RNP with generally strong discipline and effectiveness. The RNP institutionalized community relations training that included appropriate use of force and human rights, although arbitrary arrests and beatings remained problems. To address reports of theft and abuse of street vendors by District Administration Security Support Organ (DASSO) employees, authorities expanded training for DASSO. For example, in April, 515 DASSO community-security-officer trainees participated in instruction designed to promote professionalism and discipline. ARREST PROCEDURES AND TREATMENT OF DETAINEES The law requires authorities to investigate and obtain a warrant before arresting a suspect. Police may detain suspects for up to 72 hours without an arrest warrant. Prosecutors must submit formal charges within five days of arrest. Police may detain minors a maximum of 15 days in pretrial detention but only for crimes that carry a penalty for conviction of five years’ or more imprisonment. Police and prosecutors often disregarded these provisions and held individuals, sometimes for months and often without charge, particularly in security-related cases. The SSF held some suspects incommunicado or under house arrest. At times police employed nonjudicial punishment when minor criminals confessed and the victims agreed to a police officer’s recommended penalty, such as a week of detention or providing restitution. The law permits investigative detention if authorities believe public safety is threatened or the accused might flee, and judges interpreted these provisions broadly. A judge must review such detention every 30 days, which may not extend beyond one year, but the SSF held numerous suspects indefinitely after the first authorization of investigative detention and did not always seek reauthorization every 30 days. Police also routinely circumvented arrest procedures by summoning suspects for daily interrogation, requiring them to spend up to 16 hours each day at Criminal Investigations Division headquarters without formally issuing charges. After prosecutors formally file a charge, detention may be indefinite unless bail is granted. Bail exists only for crimes for which the maximum sentence if convicted is five years’ imprisonment or less, but authorities may release a suspect pending trial if satisfied the person would not flee or become a threat to public safety and order. Authorities generally allowed family members prompt access to detained relatives, unless the individuals were held on state security charges, or in unofficial or intelligence-related detention facilities. Detainees were generally allowed access to attorneys of their choice. The government at times violated the right to habeas corpus. Convicted persons sometimes remained in prison after completing their sentences while waiting for an appeal date or due to problems with prison records. The law provides that pretrial detention, illegal detention, and administrative sanctions be fully deducted from sentences imposed, but it does not provide for compensation to persons who are acquitted. The law allows judges to impose detention of equivalent duration and fines on SSF and other government officials who unlawfully detained individuals, but there were no reports that judges exercised this authority. Arbitrary Arrest : Unregistered opposition political parties reported authorities frequently detained their supporters and party officials but released most after detention of one week or less. Several, including FDU-Inkingi leaders, were detained much longer than one week. For example, the 11 members of the FDU-Inkingi Party arrested in September 2017 and charged with membership in a terrorist organization remained in custody as of September 14. In a July 30 court appearance, the attorney for the defense argued the arrests were politically motivated and asked the court to dismiss the case because prosecutors employed improper and illegal procedures in authorizing a communications intercept after the fact. On September 14, the Kigali High Court ruled that because the defendants stood accused of maintaining links to terrorist groups outside the country, the case ought to be transferred to the High Court’s special chamber for international crimes and cross-border matters, which would resume the trial at a later date. HRW reported these arrests were government efforts to crush dissent and silence the opposition. Although there is no requirement for individuals to carry an identification document (ID), police and the DASSO regularly detained street children, vendors, and beggars without IDs and sometimes charged them with illegal street vending or vagrancy. Authorities released adults who could produce an ID and transported street children to their home districts, to shelters, or for processing into vocational and educational programs. Pretrial Detention : Lengthy pretrial detention was a serious problem, and authorities often detained prisoners for months without arraignment, in large part due to administrative delays caused by case backlogs. HRW reported that when some detainees were transferred from military detention facilities to official detention facilities, military, intelligence, or police officials made detainees sign documents stating they had been arrested on the date of their transfer rather than their actual date of arrest, thereby erasing their military detention from the record. The law permits detention of genocide and terrorism suspects until trial.

e. Denial of Fair Public Trial The constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence. There were no reports of direct government interference in the judiciary, and authorities generally respected court orders. Domestic and international observers noted, however, that outcomes in high-profile genocide, security, and politically sensitive cases appeared predetermined. TRIAL PROCEDURES The constitution and law provide for the right to a fair and public trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. The law provides for a presumption of innocence and requires defendants be informed promptly and in detail of the charges in a language they comprehend. Defendants have the right to a trial without undue delay. Despite the National Public Prosecution Authority’s assertion that its prosecutors handled all cases without significant undue delay, defense lawyers reported there were an insufficient number of prosecutors, judges, and courtrooms to hold trials within a reasonable time. By law detainees are allowed access to lawyers. The expense and scarcity of lawyers and most lawyers’ reluctance to take on cases they considered sensitive for political or state security reasons, however, limited access to legal representation. Some lawyers working on politically sensitive cases reported harassment and threats by government officials, including monitoring of their communications and denial of access to evidence against their clients. Defendants have the right to communicate with an attorney of their choice, although many defendants could not afford private counsel. The law provides for legal representation of minors. The Rwandan Bar Association and 36 other member organizations of the Legal Aid Forum provided legal assistance to some indigent defendants but lacked the resources to provide defense counsel to all in need. Legal aid organizations noted that the requirement that defendants present a certificate of indigence signed by their district authorities made it difficult to qualify for pro bono representation. The law requires that defendants have adequate time and facilities to prepare their defense, and judges routinely granted requests to extend preparation time. The law provides for a right to free interpretation, but domestic human rights organizations noted that officials did not always enforce this right, particularly in cases of deaf and hard-of-hearing defendants requiring sign language interpreters. Defendants have the right to be present at trial, confront witnesses against them, and present witnesses and evidence on their own behalf. By law defendants may not be compelled to testify or confess guilt. Judges generally respected the law during trial. The law provides for the right to appeal, and authorities respected this provision. The SSF continued to coerce suspects into confessing guilt in security-related cases. Judges tended to accept confessions obtained through torture despite defendants’ protests and failed to order investigations when defendants alleged torture during their trial. The judiciary sometimes held security-related, terrorism, and high-profile political trials in closed chambers. Some defense attorneys in these cases reported irregularities and complained judges tended to disregard the rights of the accused when hearings were not held publicly. The RDF routinely tried military offenders, as well as civilians who previously served in the RDF, before military tribunals that handed down penalties of fines, imprisonment, or both for those convicted. Military courts provided defendants with similar rights as civilian courts, including the right of appeal. Defendants often appeared before military tribunals without legal counsel due to the cost of hiring private attorneys and the unwillingness of most attorneys to defend individuals accused of crimes against state security. The law stipulates military courts may try civilian accomplices of soldiers accused of crimes. In 2012 the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda transferred its remaining genocide cases to the MICT. It continued to pursue eight genocide fugitives subject to tribunal indictments. On September 3, authorities arrested five individuals wanted by the MICT for contempt of court and transferred them to the MICT offices in Tanzania. POLITICAL PRISONERS AND DETAINEES There were numerous reports that local officials and the SSF detained some individuals who disagreed publicly with government decisions or policies. Some opposition leaders and government critics faced indictment under broadly applied charges of genocide incitement, genocide denial, inciting insurrection or rebellion, or attempting to overthrow the government. Political detainees were afforded the same protections, including visitation rights, access to lawyers and doctors, and access to family members, as other detainees. Occasionally authorities held politically sensitive detainees in individual cells–even in facilities with severe overcrowding–to ensure they would not be mistreated while in detention. Numerous individuals identified by international and domestic human rights groups as political prisoners remained in prison, including Deo Mushayidi and Theoneste Niyitegeka. On September 15, the government released FDU-Inkingi president and former 2010 presidential candidate Victoire Ingabire from prison after President Kagame commuted the remainder of her sentence. Ingabire had been convicted and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment in 2012 in what was considered a flawed trial based on politically motivated charges; in 2013 the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and increased her sentence from eight to 15 years’ imprisonment. The FDU-Inkingi issued a statement saying the party hoped Ingabire’s release represented a sincere democratic opening. Minister of Justice Busingye, on the other hand, told press there was nothing political about her release since there was nothing political about her imprisonment. On October 9, the RIB summoned Ingabire for questioning and informed her that she could face legal action if she continued to characterize her conviction as political and to refer to other political prisoners. As of September 13, the government had not responded to a November 2017 ruling by the African Court on Human and People’s Rights that the government violated Ingabire’s right to freedom of expression and that her 2012 conviction in a flawed judicial process violated her right to defense. The court ordered the government to take all necessary measures to restore Ingabire’s rights and to submit to the court a report on the measures taken within six months. In addition to Ingabire, on September 14, the government granted early release to 2,139 other prisoners. Among them was Kizito Mihigo, a popular musician who was serving a 10-year prison sentence for conviction of conspiracy to kill President Kagame and other government officials. On December 6, a court acquitted presidential aspirant and vocal Kagame critic Diane Rwigara of forgery and inciting insurrection after ruling that the prosecution failed to produce sufficient evidence to substantiate the charges, which human rights organizations described as politically motivated. Diane Rwigara’s mother, Adeline Rwigara, arrested at the same time, was also acquitted of all charges. The two women were detained for more than one year before they were released on bail on October 5. Associates of Diane Rwigara also reportedly experienced harassment during the year, with some denied diplomas, fired from jobs, or taken into police custody for days at a time before being released. Rwigara’s sister, Anne Rwigara, was released in 2017. CIVIL JUDICIAL PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES The judiciary was generally independent and impartial in civil matters. Mechanisms exist for citizens to file lawsuits in civil matters, including for violations of human rights. The Office of the Ombudsman processed claims of judicial wrongdoing on an administrative basis. Individuals may submit cases to the East African Court of Justice after exhausting domestic appeals. PROPERTY RESTITUTION Reports of expropriation of land for the construction of roads, government buildings, and other infrastructure projects were common, and complainants frequently cited government failure to provide adequate and timely compensation. The National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) investigated some of these cases and advocated on citizens’ behalf with relevant local and national authorities but was unable to effect restitution in a majority of the cases. In one instance residents refused to vacate their land and took the government to court to contest the expropriation. The case was pending at year’s end. The government continued harassment of the family of Assinapol Rwigara whose death, the family claimed, was a politically motivated killing by SSF members via an automobile accident in 2015. After Assinapol’s daughter, Diane, was disqualified from running in the 2017 presidential election, the government initiated criminal proceedings against the family for alleged nonpayment of taxes. In March, June, and October, authorities auctioned off assets belonging to the Rwigaras worth 2.2 billion Rwandan francs ($2.5 million) because of the alleged arrears.",https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/rwanda/
Museveni tasks army to ‘deal’ with Rwanda security forces who shoot unarmed Ugandans,"KAMPALA — President Museveni has directed resident district commissioners (RDCs) to “deal” with Rwanda security forces that cross over to Ugandan territory to kidnap and shoot dead unarmed Ugandans.

In an August 4, 2020 letter to all RDCs, Minister for Presidency Esther Mbayo also directed RDCs to warn residents against illegal entry into Rwanda.

“His Excellency the President has sent a directive, especially to you RDCs, especially those in the districts neighbouring Rwanda to inform Ugandans of the Rwanda government criminal policy of shooting smugglers that are not armed, although what they are doing is illegal. Ugandans should stop going to Rwanda or those who go do so at their own risk,” the letter reads in part.

“As for the Rwandan soldiers infiltrating into Uganda to kidnap people, the concerned security agencies are already briefed on how to deal with them,” the letter adds.

It is not immediately clear how the Ugandan army will deal with the Rwandans.

The letter comes amid a stalemate in the ongoing talks between the two countries to resolve the diplomatic impasse that led to the closure of the border by Rwanda.

The virtual meeting of the ad hoc commission for the normalisation of relations between Uganda and Rwanda ended in June 2020 without a position, especially on the opening of the Gatuna border point.

The meeting was the first of the commission since the fourth Quadripartite Heads of State Summit of President Museveni, Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, Angola’s Joao Laurenco, and DRC’s Felix Tshisekedi on February 21 at the Katuna/ Gatuna border.

Kagame, 62, accuses his former ally of backing rebel groups and dissidents who want to bring down the government in Kigali. Kigali has also accused Kampala of targeting its nationals, with the government advising Rwandans to avoid Uganda.

Museveni has denied that his country supports the rebel groups and has instead accused Kigali of trying to violate its sovereignty.

Despite Kampala releasing some of Rwanda nationals from jail, signs of resolving the standoff are not near. Instead, Rwanda has been shooting dead Ugandans who are caught smuggling different items to Rwanda.

Bill Clinton’s Shameful Genocide Denial,"Bill Clinton’s Shameful Genocide Denial

“If the horrors of the Holocaust taught us anything,” Bill Clinton said before becoming president, “it is the high cost of remaining silent and paralyzed in the face of genocide. Even as our fragmentary awareness of crimes grew into indisputable facts, far too little was done. We must not permit that to happen again.”

Clinton’s words were stirring, but they reflected a broad consensus among the Western powers after World War II: another Holocaust could not be allowed to occur. By the time of the Clinton Administration, this had become an article of American political faith, one of the country’s few solid moral commitments: whatever other misfortunes we might inflict through our actions and inactions across the globe, the United States would never permit the tragedies of 1939-1945 to replay themselves.

The events in Rwanda during 1994 would be the true test of the country’s commitment to the principle. It was the precise scenario that each president had solemnly sworn an oath to prevent. Moreover, the country had the resources, opportunity, and knowledge necessary to help. It was, fundamentally, an event that could have been stopped, or at least significantly mitigated, through the taking of steps that were known and feasible. But over the course of 100 days, as literally hundreds of thousands of bodies piled up in Rwanda, President Clinton did exactly what he had promised he would never do; he remained “silent and paralyzed in the face of genocide,” and even as his “fragmentary awareness grew into indisputable facts,” he lackadaisically “permitted it to happen again.”

But even worse, and seldom acknowledged, is that Clinton did something far worse. He did not just “sit on his hands”: he deliberately stalled the efforts of others to intervene, and went so far as to deny the genocide in order to avoid being pressured to stop it.

The most important thing to understand, in analyzing international responsibility for the genocide, is whether enough information was available to the decision-makers. A person cannot be held accountable for not stopping something he did not know was occurring. Indeed, Bill Clinton, according to Samantha Power, “is said to have convinced himself that if he had known more, he would have done more.” He claimed in 1998 that he did not “fully appreciate the depth and the speed with which [Rwandans] were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror.” Clinton offers his present-day charitable works in Rwanda as proof that once he is made aware of suffering there, he will dedicate himself diligently to alleviating it, that he would never leave Rwanda to perish if he knew he was capable of acting.

But Clinton’s claim not to have fully understood the situation is a lie. Clinton knew. Knew there was a genocide, knew its scale. People at all levels of government knew. It was all over the press. In fact, the idea that any informed official at the time could plead ignorance to the Rwandan genocide is laughable. As time passes, it may be easier and easier to blur the history, to suggest that everything was opaque and uncertain and that it would have taken impossible omniscience in order to understand. But the violence in Rwanda was in the newspapers. It wasn’t just the stuff of minor internal State Department memoranda and overlooked faxes at the bottom of receptionists’ inboxes. It was in The New York Times and The Washington Post. The Administration’s spokespeople was being regularly asked about it.

It’s easy enough, if we know nothing about it, to accept the proposition that the scale of the Rwanda genocide became clear only after the fact. Fog of war and all that. It certainly comports with the received image of Africa as a dark and unfathomable continent, out of which reliable information never flows. But any glance through contemporary sources instantly invalidates this view of history. To say one didn’t know is not just implausible or unlikely. It is a lie.

When assessing the question of “knowledge,” and the subsequent issue of culpability, it is vital to keep in mind the timeline of the genocide, and to figure out what information was available at what points. Again, remember that President Clinton, in tearfully apologizing to Rwandans, said he did not “fully appreciate the depth and the speed” with which Rwandans were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror.”

On April 6th, 1994, the day before the Rwandan genocide began, the country’s president had been assassinated, his plane shot down over Kigali by parties unknown. It was the small spark necessary to trigger a genocide; the president was a Hutu, and the killing provided the necessary pretext for the country’s military forces to carry out a plan they had been working on for some time: the extermination of their ethnic rivals, the Tutsi minority. On April 7th, a motley assemblage of paramilitary forces, under the direction of high-ranking members of the political elite, began a concerted program of mass slaughter. Inspired by an apocalyptic “Hutu Power” ideology, and fueled by “hate radio” stations commanding ordinary citizens to kill, groups of machete-wielding death squads roamed through the country, killing every Tutsi they could find, as well as moderate Hutus. In this nationwide paroxysm of stabbing, raping, and shooting, hundreds of thousands would be killed over the next 100 days.

The Rwandan president was assassinated on the 6th, a Wednesday. The killings began on Thursday the 7th and lasted three months. On the Thursday, members of the Presidential Guard killed eleven Belgian UN peacekeepers, as well as the Rwandan prime minister. On Friday the 8th, Bill Clinton publicly stated that the prime minister had been “sought out and murdered. Reuters described a “wave of bloodletting” in which “embers of the security forces and gangs of youths wielding machetes, knives and clubs rampaged through the capital, Kigali, settling tribal scores by hacking and clubbing people to death or shooting them.”

On Saturday, April 9th, Clinton included references to Rwanda in his weekly radio address (which was “otherwise devoted to crime and other domestic issues” and focused largely on Clinton’s pitch for his crime bill.) Of the situation there, he said:

Finally, let me say just a brief word about a very tragic situation in the African nation of Rwanda. I’m deeply concerned about the continuing violence… There are about 250 Americans there. I’m very concerned about their safety, and I want you to know that we’re doing all we can to ensure their safety.

That same day, United Nations observers in Kigali witnessed a massacre that took place in a Polish church, in which over one hundred people including children were brutally hacked to death. The New York Times described Rwanda and Burundi as “two nations joined by a common history of genocide,” raising the specter of the g-word.

On the 11th, The New York Times published the accounts of Americans who had recently evacuated:

‘It was the most basic terror,’ said Chris Grundmann, 37, an American evacuee, describing the fears of the Rwandan civilians and officials who were targets of the violence. He and his family, hunkered down in their house with mattresses against the windows, heard the ordeals of Rwandan victims over a two-way radio.‘The U.N. radio was filled with national staff screaming for help,’ he said. ‘They were begging: ‘Come save me! My house is being blown up,’ or ‘They’re killing me.’ There was nothing we could do. At one point we just had to turn it off.’ Since Wednesday, it is estimated that more than 20,000 people have been killed in fighting between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority that have struggled for dominance since Rwanda won independence from Belgium in 1962. On Friday alone, the main hospital had many hundreds of bodies before noon. Mr. Grundmann, an official with the Centers for Disease Control [said that] the family’s cook, a Tutsi, came to their home begging for help on Friday after having spent three days pretending to be dead. ‘He told us that on Wednesday night someone had thrown a grenade into his home… He escaped through an open window, but he thinks his wife and children died. For 36 hours he played dead in a marsh. There were bodies all through the marsh. He said there were heads being thrown in.’

On April 12th, The New York Times printed a profile of several Adventist missionaries who had fled:

“Now that we are out,” Mr. Van Lanen said today, “I fear, in a way, that we have betrayed the people we came to help. Now, they fear that most of those people—deprived of their protection—will become victims of the bloodletting that has set the majority Hutu tribe of Rwanda against the minority Tutsis. Red Cross officials estimate that the violence has taken more than 10,000 lives in Kigali alone, and as many or more in the countryside

That same day, Toronto’s Globe and Mail ran a report containing interviews with traumatized Canadians who had evacuated:

“There were bodies everywhere. Wounded people were not getting any attention. Women with children on their backs were hacked to pieces. I saw one man still alive who was disembowelled, another had almost been cut in half with a panga (a long, sharp knife).” The streets of Kigali were like a “slaughterhouse” and “blood was literally flowing in the gutters.”

On the 15th, The New York Times published a report about the refugees gathered in at the Hotel Milles Collines, later made well-known in the film Hotel Rwanda:

In Kigali, scores of Rwandans have taken refuge at the Hotel Mille Collines. There is an uneasy, nervous coexistence there between the families of the Rwandan military and some middle-class Tutsis who were unable to leave the city. Both are convinced they will be massacred. They congregate in the dark hallways, whispering for hours, virtual prisoners. As United Nations soldiers came to take the foreign journalists to the airport, dozens of the Rwandans crowded around and begged to be evacuated, fearing that the departure of Westerners would mean sure death for them. Their pleas were rejected by the troops. As the convoy left, many gathered silently in the driveway and stared.

On the 16th, the Montreal Gazette published a desperate plea from a Rwandan exile, under the headline “Don’t abandon us”:

[Fidele Makombe] says he was stunned by the orgy of murder, rape and torture unleashed in the small central African nation… Human-rights observers are convinced that the coterie of ethnic Hutus around the president used the incident as a pretext to unleash a reign of terror… Makombe, who runs the Rwandese Human Rights League from his base here, is appealing to the world not to kiss off Rwanda as another African human-rights basket case, but to understand the true nature of the conflict…

The killings in Rwanda were no secret, then. Every day, the papers were full of them; these are random examples, one could offer many, many more clippings from the Washington Post, The New York Times, and the various wire services, and these were just from the first weeks of a genocide that went on unimpeded for three months without Clinton acting. By April 24th, the Sunday Washington Post was filled with pleas from Human Rights Watch, who explained unequivocally what was going on:

We put the word genocide on the table. We don’t do it lightly. There is clearly here an intention an eliminate the Tutsi as a people… This is not “inter-tribal fighting” or “ethnic conflict.” First, it’s not fighting, it’s slaughter…

A front page Post story from the same day described “the heads and limbs of victims… sorted and piled neatly, a bone-chilling order in the midst of chaos that harked back to the Holocaust.”

To not “fully appreciate” what was going on would have required not glancing at a newspaper for the three months from the beginning of April to the beginning of July.

It’s important to provide excerpts from some of these contemporary media accounts, so as not to accidentally lapse into believing that the genocide was something hidden or unknown. After such a calamity, for which so many are culpable, a great number of people have vested interests in downplaying the extent to which the genocide was (1) knowable and (2) preventable. If only to spare themselves a lifetime of guilt, they must publicly repeat that the situation was unclear, and that nothing could be done. But the historical record says otherwise; very little was unclear, and even those things that were unknown on April 8th were certainly clear by the 20th, when fleeing survivors’ reports of genocide were being recounted in the press daily. As April turned to May, the nation’s papers were openly puzzled by Clinton’s refusal to do anything. On May 2nd, the editorial board of USA Today angrily denounced Clinton for his uselessness:

Imagine the horror of watching 25 mutilated bodies float down a local river – every hour. Try to picture 250,000 North Carolinians abandoning their homes and belongings in a terrified run for their lives from machete-wielding madmen. That’s what life is like these days in Rwanda, a small but densely populated Central African nation where as many as 200,000 men, women and children have been slaughtered in the past three weeks… Where is the world’s horror? And, more immediately, where is the world’s outrage? Surely, if hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians were hacked to death in France or Germany, the international call for action would be swift and strong. But Rwanda is in Africa. And, unfortunately, the Western world reacts slowly to black-on-black violence. President Clinton, who criticized George Bush for not doing more to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, certainly took his time getting around to this genocide. Only last weekend did he finally deliver a radio address, broadcast in Rwanda, pleading for an end to the violence. That’s about three weeks – 200,000 victims – too slow.

But if the editors at USA Today thought Clinton would spring into action after 200,000 victims, they were mistaken. Besides the evacuation of Americans, Clinton’s radio address to Rwandans (which Human Rights Watch called “so mild as to be worthless”) would constitute the full extent of the U.S.’s action in the country until July.

In fact, there was a conscious commitment to inaction by the Clinton Administration. As Princeton Lyman, then serving as U.S. Ambassador to South Africa recalls, “[p]eople knew what was going on…There certainly was information flowing in. The African Bureau at the State Department was pleading for the Pentagon to bomb the hate radio stations. People had information. There was just a reluctance to do very much.” Former State Department military advisor Tony Marley describes a meeting at the State Department:

One official even asked a question as to what possible outcome there might be on the congressional elections later that year were the administration to acknowledge that this was genocide taking place in Rwanda and be seen to do nothing about it. The concern obviously was whether it would result in a loss of votes for the party in the November elections… I was stunned because I didn’t see what bearing that had on whether or not genocide was, in fact, taking place in Rwanda. Partisan political vote-gathering in the U.S. had no bearing on the objective reality in Rwanda.

Marley said that even modest proposal for action were instantly rejected. When Marley suggested that they at least attempt to jam the frequencies hate radio stations that were fueling the genocide, a State Department lawyer told him it would go against the spirit of the U.S. Constitution’s commitment to free speech. (For the record, United States constitutional law does not protect the right to order a genocide on the radio.)

But the Clinton Administration actually did something much, much worse than failing to intervene. It deliberately attempted to downplay the atrocities, refusing to refer to them publicly as genocide, for fear that doing so would obligate them under the U.S.’s Genocide Convention to take action. As The Guardian reported in 2004, classified documents showed that “President Bill Clinton’s administration knew Rwanda was being engulfed by genocide in April 1994 but buried the information to justify its inaction… Senior officials privately used the word genocide within 16 days of the start of the killings, but chose not to do so publicly because the president had already decided not to intervene.” “Detailed reports” were reaching the top levels of government; Secretary of State Warren Christopher “and almost certainly the president” had been told mid-April that there was “genocide and partition” and a “final solution to eliminate all Tutsis.” The CIA’s national intelligence briefing, circulated to Clinton, Al Gore, and other top officials, “included almost daily reports on Rwanda,” with an April 23 briefing saying that rebels were attempting to “stop the genocide, which… is spreading south.” As William Ferroggiaro of the National Security Archive explained, declassified documents show that “[d]iplomats, intelligence agencies, defense and military officials – even aid workers – provided timely information up the chain… That the Clinton administration decided against intervention at any level was not for lack of knowledge of what was happening in Rwanda.” Joyce Leader, U.S. Embassy’s deputy chief of mission in Kigali, admitted in 2014 that “We had a very good sense of what was taking place.”

But nobody in the United States government was willing to use the word “genocide” publicly. The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide contains a binding requirement that countries prevent genocide, so acknowledgment of the genocide would have created a legally binding mandate to stop it. Even though internally, members of the Clinton Administration were referring to a genocide, publicly their spokespeople were under strict orders to refuse to confirm that a genocide was occurring, for fear that it “could inflame public calls for action.”

“Be careful,” warned a document from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense’s office, “Legal at State was worried about this yesterday – Genocide finding could commit U.S.G. to actually ‘do something.’”

The resulting press conferences took Clintonian hairsplitting to its most absurd outer limits. Here, reporters try to pin down State Department spokesperson Christine Shelley and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright:

REPORTER 1: —comment on that, or a view as to whether or not what is happening could be genocide?

CHRISTINE SHELLEY: Well, as I think you know, the use of the term “genocide” has a very precise legal meaning, although it’s not strictly a legal determination. There are—there are other factors in there, as well. When—in looking at a situation to make a determination about that, before we begin to use that term, we have to know as much as possible about the facts of the situation.

REPORTER 2: Just out of curiosity, given that so many people say that there is genocide underway, or something that strongly resembles it, why wouldn’t this convention be invoked?

MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I think, as you know, this becomes a legal definitional thing, unfortunately, in terms of—as horrendous as all these things are, there becomes a definitional question.

Finally, at the end of May, as hundreds of thousands lay dead across Rwanda, the Clinton Administration changed its policy and began using the term. But even then they took great pains to use a carefully-constructed legalism; while they would admit that there may have been “acts of genocide” occurring, they drew a distinction between these and “genocide,” in the apparent belief that this would keep them from triggering the Genocide Convention.

Again, reporters tried to get a straight answer:

CHRISTINE SHELLEY: We have every reason to believe that acts of genocide have occurred.

ALAN ELSNER (REUTERS): How many acts of genocide does it take to make genocide?

CHRISTINE SHELLEY: Alan, that’s just not a question that I’m in a position to answer.

ALAN ELSNER: Is it true that the—that you have specific guidance not use the word “genocide” in isolation, but always to preface it with this—this word, “acts of”?

CHRISTINE SHELLEY: I have guidance, which—to which I—which I try to use as best as I can. I’m not—I have—there are formulations that we are using that we are trying to be consistent in our use of.

Alan Elsner later described his incredulity at the Administration’s non-responsiveness:

The answers they were giving were really non-answers. They would talk in incredibly bureaucratic language. In a sense, it was almost like a caricature. If you look at it now, it looks utterly ridiculous. These were all kind of artful ways of doing nothing, which is what they were determined to do.

Not only did the Clinton Administration adopt a policy of refusing to recognize the genocide, but it pressured other countries to do the same. Former Czech Ambassador to the U.N. Karel Kovanda recalled that his government was pressured by the U.S. not to use the term:

KAREL KOVANDA: I know that I personally had an important conversation with one of my superiors in Prague who at American behest suggested that they lay off.

INTERVIEWER: Lay off calling it genocide?

KAREL KOVANDA: Yeah. Lay off pushing Rwanda, in general, and calling it genocide specifically.

INTERVIEWER: So the Americans had actually talked to your government back in Prague and said, ‘Don’t let’s call it genocide.’

KAREL KOVANDA: In Prague or in Washington, but they were talking to my superiors, yes.

There is much to be revolted by here. Despite Clinton’s promise that he would never sit idly by while genocide was occurring, not only was he doing exactly that, but his administration actually perpetrated a planned act of genocide denial specifically in order to avoid having to prevent a genocide from occurring. As The Guardian reported, the Clinton Administration, “felt the US had no interests in Rwanda, a small central African country with no minerals or strategic value.” Thanks to Rwanda’s lack of minerals, the world’s most powerful nation was content to let 800,000 people have their faces chopped off with machetes.

But even this underplays the Clinton Administration’s responsibility. It’s true that the U.S. government both deliberately refused to send forces to Rwanda and deceived the world about whether a genocide was occurring. It’s also true that both then and now, Bill Clinton pretended that there was too little information to come to any conclusions all while receiving detailed briefings on the genocide (as it was simultaneously splashed across the daily papers). But perhaps even worse, the Clinton Administration actually took affirmative steps to keep the United Nations from sending a force to Rwanda. As Samantha Power explains:

In reality the United States did much more than fail to send troops. It led a successful effort to remove most of the UN peacekeepers who were already in Rwanda. It aggressively worked to block the subsequent authorization of UN reinforcements.

“Recall,” said former special envoy to Somalia Robert Oakley, “it wasn’t just not sending U.S. forces: we blocked a security council resolution to send in a U.N. force.” Indeed, Clinton Administration deliberately stalled United Nations efforts to coordinate an intervention. According to Foreign Policy, “[w]hen the genocide began, the United States launched a diplomatic campaign aimed at bringing the U.N. peacekeepers home. Initially, Washington sought to shutter the mission entirely.” On May 17th, The New York Times reported that “The United States forced the United Nations… to scale down its plans and put off sending 5,500 African troops to Rwanda in an effort to end the violence there… Washington argued that sending in a large peacekeeping force raised the risk of the troops’ being caught up in the fighting.” There was “a decisive U.S. role in the tragic pullout of United Nations peacekeepers” and each time the United Nations attempted to formulate a modest plan for reprieve, the United States stalled it, even to the extent of using its Security Council veto power over other nations.

One may wonder why the Clinton Administration acted so callously in the face of such a preventable catastrophe. But one need not wonder long. The relevant considerations were explained by Bill Clinton during his commencement speech at the Naval Academy in May of 1994, during the middle of the genocide:

Now the entire global terrain is bloody with such conflicts, from Rwanda to Georgia… Whether we get involved in any of the world’s ethnic conflicts, in the end, must depend on the cumulative weight of the American interests at stake.

There, in plain language, was Clinton’s philosophy. “The cumulative weight of the American interests at stake” were the deciding factor when it came to “ethnic conflicts” like the Rwandan genocide. With few American interests in Kigali (no minerals), there was little that needed to be done.

Clinton’s close political advisor, Dick Morris, was even more explicit in describing the president’s reasoning:

The real reason was that Rwanda was black. Bosnia was white. European atrocities mattered more than African atrocities—not to Clinton himself, but to the media, which covered the grisly deaths in Yugoslavia but devoted considerably less attention to the genocide in Africa. And without the media dogging him to take action, Bill Clinton…wasn’t about to pay attention.

The words of a jaded and disreputable operative like Dick Morris may of course be taken with some skepticism. And he underplays the extent to which the media was covering the genocide. But as USA Today noted, it’s hard to believe that if the same circumstances had occurred in a European country, Clinton would have shown the same level of indifference. The president’s treatment of Rwanda had everything to do with a political calculus; Administration officials were openly concerned with the situation’s effects on the November election. (They lost anyway.)

Bill Clinton has struggled to explain why he did not intervene in Rwanda. In 1998, he visited Kigali and offered what some have described as an “apology,” though it did not contain much actual apologizing. In that statement, Clinton admitted that “[i]t may seem strange to you here, especially the many of you who lost members of your family, but all over the world there were people like me sitting in offices, day after day after day, who did not fully appreciate” the depth of the terror.

Indeed it did seem strange, because it was, in fact, impossible. As Rwanda scholar Timothy Longman wrote, “Clinton’s claims were false. It is not that the U.S. government didn’t know what was happening in Rwanda. The truth is that we didn’t care.” And as Samantha Power has concluded, “[a]s the terror in Rwanda had unfolded, Clinton had shown virtually no interest in stopping the genocide, and his Administration had stood by as the death toll rose into the hundreds of thousands.”

Even as he constructed the appearance of regret, then, Bill Clinton was engaging in political spin. Dana Hughes of ABC News reports on an internal memo from late in 1994, offering talking points with which the president could cover himself. The memo:

suggests the president argue that the United States took appropriate and swift action in Rwanda after it was clear there was genocide, and that the U.S. was one of many countries who authorized the United Nations to pull out of the country right before the atrocities began. In short, says the memo, the U.S. ‘did the right thing’ and shares no responsibility for allowing the genocide to occur. Clinton himself echoed these sentiments in comments to the press a few months earlier where he said he had ‘done all he could do’ to help the people of Rwanda.

One of the most disturbing aspects of Clinton’s conduct around Rwanda is that he has been willing to lie about it and twist it in order to paint himself as sincerely oblivious and well-intentioned. The existing evidence incontrovertibly proves that Clinton failed to intervene because he didn’t see anything to be gained domestically. This is not a conspiracy theory, or a speculative hypothesis. Clinton’s own words from the time of the genocide, about the “cumulative weight of American interests,” affirm what witnesses from his Administration have said.

The evidence also proves that the Clinton Administration went far beyond inaction. It also attempted to stop others from acting. But worst of all, it adopted a conscious policy of genocide denial. It knew there was a genocide, but publicly fudged the truth so as not to have to stop it. This is actually far, far worse than even Holocaust denial; after all, the most harmful time to deny a genocide is while it is occurring, especially if your denial made deliberately so that nobody will stop the genocide. At the peak of one of the 20th centuries worst mass slaughters, Bill Clinton presided over an act of institutionalized genocide denial so as to allow the slaughter to continue.

Perhaps, in a just world, Bill Clinton would in prison for conspiracy to deny a genocide. But we live in this world, in which he is likely to return to the White House.

Adapted from the upcoming Current Affairs book “Superpredator: Bill Clinton’s Use and Abuse of Black America.” Pre-order today for shipping July 1st.",https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/05/bill-clintons-shameful-genocide-denial
Alumna Jennifer Cobbina discusses the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement as seen in this summer’s protests - UMSL Daily,"Jennifer Cobbina wasn’t content to let official narratives shape her views about the circumstances in Ferguson and Baltimore that preceded the police killings of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

The University of Missouri–St. Louis alumna-turned-associate-professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University went to ground level, conducting interviews with nearly 200 residents of the two locales within two months of Brown’s and Gray’s deaths.

The things she heard about their experiences with police, both before the killings and during protests that followed, are gathered in “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot: Why the Protests in Ferguson and Baltimore Matter, and How They Changed America.” The 2019 book explores the Black Lives Matter movement around race, justice and policing in the United States.

The deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of law enforcement earlier this year in Minneapolis and Louisville, respectively, have further crystallized the movement’s central issues and sparked a new wave of protests across the country.

UMSL Daily reached out to Cobbina (PhD in criminology and criminal justice, 2009) to discuss this summer’s demonstrations and whether anything seems different in America’s latest moment of reckoning with racism.

When “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” was published last year, did you have an expectation that it was only a matter of time before there was another incident of police violence that would again lead to widespread protests?

Yes. That is because there has not been any effort to address America’s history of racial injustice and own up to the way that racial bias and legalized racial subordination has compromised our ability to implement criminal justice. As a result, any attempts to implement reforms to the police without explicitly addressing the history of injustice, deep trauma of harmed communities and the role of the law and its institutions in producing it will not work as it should. It will be mediocre at best or fail at worst. We cannot effectively address crime reduction and prevention or community engagement and inclusion if history is ignored.

What differences do you see in the protests of George Floyd’s death and that of Breonna Taylor – and the reaction to them – compared to what transpired in the aftermath of the deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray?

Following Michael Brown’s and Freddie Gray’s deaths, tens of thousands of people protested systemic racism, police violence and broader structural inequalities. Activists were comprised largely of Black people. But you still had much of the public who were not in agreement with the Black Lives Matter movement, as many bought into the misconception that the movement only believed that Black life matters. But contained within the statement is an unspoken yet implied “too,” as in “black lives matter, too,” which suggests that the statement is one of inclusion rather than exclusion.

This summer is the latest chapter in a story that has not been changing. In recent years, the killings of unarmed Black men, women, boys and girls have captured national and international attention. Modern-day killings of unarmed Black men, women and children have struck a conscious chord across the nation, as much of the public bears witness to the police operating with impunity.

What is new today is a critical mass of people saying, “Enough is enough.” George Floyd’s and Breonna Taylor’s deaths have sparked sustained protests across the world. Amid COVID-19, millions of people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds in large metropolitan cities and small rural towns have taken to the streets to protest.

This is taking place because the Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged in 2013 after the murder acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin, has been strategizing, organizing and mobilizing. It is why we now see the Black Lives Matter movement as the largest movement in U.S. history.

Social media also played a huge role in spotlighting these issues of police violence and systemic racism. While racism is not new, its blatant acts of state violence are being filmed.

In the midst of a pandemic, when most people are home, people cannot ignore or claim that they are not aware of the devaluation and oppression of Black life. Many white people have come to recognize the ways in which they may have been complicit in systemic racism and are taking anti-racist actions and seeking to dismantle systems that are inside and outside of them.

From your experience doing research in Ferguson and Baltimore, what are the main things national media has missed in its coverage of these tragedies? How different, if at all, is the national narrative from what local residents think and feel? And were you surprised by any of these differences?

In much of the coverage of these tragedies, there is often little consideration as to how historical racial oppression plays out in modern-day race relations and police practices. From the very beginning of American society, the police – first in the form of slave patrols, which were in charge of capturing, terrorizing and returning runaway slaves, and later in the form of official police departments – have historically engaged in racially biased policing. From slave patrols to slave codes to black codes to Jim Crow and to the criminalization and mass incarceration of Black people, the police have upheld and enforced unjust, discriminatory laws for 401 years.

Local and national activists are all decrying systemic racism terrorizing the Black community. They are decrying police brutality. People are demanding equity, equality and justice for all.

What changes are most needed to break the cycle that keeps playing out?

I believe it is necessary to divest in police and prison expansion and to invest instead in resources that create safety for Black people and people of color. This includes high quality public schools, clean and affordable housing, mental health care, the creation of living wage jobs with health care and benefits, youth development programs and social programs. Investing in human-centered services would help to stabilize communities. Rather than continuing to feed a culture of control, we must advocate for creating a culture of care where individuals, especially Black and brown people in marginalized communities, are nurtured so they can thrive. Cries to defund the police are about investing in social policies that prevent people from experiencing violence and harm in the first place. That is the way we transform and claim healthy, safe futures for our children, our elders and everyone.

In addition, we have been repeating history for 401 years because the U.S. has not publicly and systematically addressed the history and legacy of slavery. If healing and trust is to transpire, we need to:

Recognize pain and harm. As a nation, we need to engage in truth-telling about harm that has been caused.

Take responsibility for pain in an unconditional way. Acknowledge without making excuses.

Make reparations for harm. Restitution and reparations need to take place to ensure non-recurrence of harm.

The United States is not the only country that has a violent history. Apartheid took place in South Africa, genocide took place in Rwanda and the Holocaust took place in Germany. But there has been a commitment to truth and reconciliation in South Africa. Rwanda has understood the necessity for transitional justice – measures taken to redress human rights abuse – in order for there to be healing. People who visit Berlin, Germany, will encounter stones and markers of Jewish families who were abducted and taken into concentration camps. These countries offer examples as to how we as a country can heal and move forward.

What made you want to become a criminologist?

I was always interested in why people commit crimes and how to promote desistance from crime. I was outraged by the systemic barriers in place that make it difficult for people with a criminal record to integrate back into the community. The reality is one’s debt is never paid even after a person has served his or her time. I wanted to better understand the challenges people with a felony record faced and amplify their voices so systemic change can happen.

What made you decide to pursue your PhD at UMSL? How was your experience? Which faculty members were most influential for you?

When I was a junior in college, I knew I wanted to be a professor. I was fortunate to have an African American professor mentor me and encourage me to apply to several doctoral programs. Honestly, I ended up going to UMSL because they offered me the most funding as a graduate student, and it was great to see that they were ranked top 10 in criminology and criminal justice.

I had a great experience at UMSL and learned a lot. Jody Miller influenced me the most, as she taught me how to do rigorous qualitative research. I was drawn to this type of methodology and received extraordinary training from her. Rod Brunson and Beth Huebner also served as my mentors, and I continue to collaborate with them today.

Did your interests in police-community relations and prisoner reentry and recidivism originate before you started in the doctoral program, or did they develop during your time in the program and afterward?

All of these interests originated while in the doctoral program and afterward. While in the doctoral program, I had a large interest in prisoner reentry and the challenges people faced following release, which increased the odds of recidivism. I also paid attention to the role of race in the reentry process.

My interest in police-community relations did not develop until a few years after I received my PhD. While I was well aware of the role of race in the criminal justice system, I didn’t actually study this issue empirically until I conducted research in Ferguson and Baltimore in which I sought to understand activists’ experiences with the police.

I know another UMSL PhD graduate, Thomas Holt, is now the director of the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State. Do you do much work with other UMSL PhD graduates or collaborate with any UMSL faculty members?

I have collaborated with Chris Melde on a grant on school safety. This project is a mixed-methods longitudinal study of the causes and consequences of school violence among youth who transition into high school. We chose to conduct the study in Flint, Michigan, because the city has high rates of community crime, including violent crime. This project examines: 1) the nature and interconnectedness of school and community violence in Flint, Michigan, among fifth-ninth grade students, 2) how school and community violence impacts and is understood by students in the transition from elementary schools (K-eighth) to a large high school and 3) how this information can be utilized to develop a comprehensive plan to improve the transition experience for youth as they enter high school.

The ultimate goal is to promote school safety. The plan is to reduce the threat of victimization for students (both on the way to and from school as well as on school grounds), increase school engagement, improve mental health and reduce the probability of dropout.

Gendered Violence as a Weapon of Mass Destruction,"59 Pages Posted: 19 Nov 2015

Date Written: November 12, 2015

Abstract

In warfare, as well as in peacetime, women have long been, and still are, targeted for and subjected to different forms of visible and invisible violence, as well as gender-based persecution. During both civil and international armed conflicts, women have been victimized at home, in public, and in refugee camps with reference to their ethnic, national, and religious backgrounds. However, the systematic wartime rape of women in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, which took on an organized form and was adopted on a massive scale as a strategic weapon of war, leaving tens of thousands of physically and psychologically devastated women, brought this grievous crime into the international legal arena.

Wartime rape must be regarded as one of the most grievous crimes against humanity. This act of aggression, motivated by hatred, contempt, oppression, and intimidation, is seldom driven by the perpetrator’s sexual desire, since the rapist’s sexuality is used simply as a mechanical weapon of war to execute a violent act that humiliates and inflicts a spiritual injury upon both the victim and her society. In most cases, wartime rape stems from the traditional belief that women are the property of men and that, by ravishing them, the perpetrators will gain an upper hand over their male opponents.

This chapter establishes a framework for understanding the nature and contours of sexual violence through case-studies of systematic rape as an integral element of ethnic conflict and genocide in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. It provides a critical view of the ideology of wartime sexual violence, wartime rape motivations, and the historical invisibility of this crime of which women were, and still are, the primary targets and defenceless victims. Moreover, it argues that the wartime rape of mainly Bosnian Muslim and Rwandan Tutsi women emerged as a powerful instrument of annihilation, whether as a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing or as the inspiration of a moment, driven by deep ethnic hatred. Finally, it demonstrates how such victimization shaped the Serb and Hutu rapists’ ethno-national agenda.",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2690022
