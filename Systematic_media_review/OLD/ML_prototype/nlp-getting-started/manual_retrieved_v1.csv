['Details have started emerging about the nature of Brigadier General Dan Gapfizi’s fatal car crash that claimed five lives - including the General’s- on Tuesday.The deceased include the General’s driver another occupant identified as Ferdinand Akumuntu a lady identified as Therese Mukabasinga a pedestrian  and another man whose identities was not readily available by press time but was reportedly on a bicycle.The accident occurred at 5.30pm between Karangazi and Kizirakome on the Kagitumba-Kayonza highway in Eastern Province.The only survivor was the General’s escort who is currently admitted at Rwanda Military Hospital in a critical condition.Gapfizi born in 1957 in Ruhango District Southern Province will be laid to rest today at Kanombe Military Cemetery in Kigali. The accident was caused by a pedestrian and a cyclist according to eye witnesses.Ambrose Agaba who described the accident as the worst he had ever seen told The New Times yesterday that the General’s Land Cruiser vehicle first hit the pedestrian and then the cyclist before veering off the road.“A cyclist and a pedestrian were moving alongside each other seemingly chatting. The manner in which they moved suggested that one of them was on the road. The vehicle crashed into them before its driver lost control...it rolled down the road killing its occupants. It was a horrible accident.” According to Agaba the deceased pedestrian was an office messenger at Karangazi Sector who was retiring home from work.Rescue efforts were carried out by an army helicopter and the General died enroute Kigali for treatment.“This is a busy highway (Kagitumba). You expect vehicles to be speeding and pedestrians to keep a distance. Unfortunately people don’t take care and the accident could have been a result of such carelessness.”Emmanuel Rukera the late Akumuntu’s neighbour said the family was still struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. Akumuntu was a driver who worked with a number of government officials in the country. He was reportedly working with the National Electoral Commission by the time of his death.“Akumuntu was only 35 years he is survived by two children...we are laying his body to rest today [yesterday] in Kanombe. His family is very close to me which is why I find myself in almost similar sad situation. He was a good friend of the late General” Rukera said.Meanwhile Superintendent Emmanuel Karuranga the Eastern Province Police spokesman urged all road users to be careful.“The spot where the accident occurred is flat with gently sloping corners tricky for all road users. Pedestrians drivers cyclists should be careful when using the road. There is a mobile police unit to monitor road safety as a result” he said.Fourty-one accidents were reported in the Eastern Province between January and May 2013 according to Police.The 2012 police accidents report indicates that 308 lives were lost last year in road accidents in the country.May recorded the most deaths with 44 deaths followed by July with 42 while fewer deaths were recorded in June (23) and April (24).Thirty-three people have perished in road accidents in Eastern Province alone between August and October last year.

Last Friday as voters hurried home for the weekend the first blast killed one and injured fourteen others."" '' ""The next day there was a second explosion at the Kicukiro Centre. As a heavy shower early on Saturday afternoon drove shoppers and Boda Boda drivers for cover underneath an overhang in front of the market a muffled explosion cut through the din of the rain. At first locals and Boda Boda drivers joked that the sound was merely fireworks but through the rain's patter shrieks confirmed the worst."" '' 'As the deluge slowed to a drizzle a burnt smell wafted through the air and traders carried the wounded out of the market. After one youth was carried from the centre a woman emerged struggling to run in the muddy street screaming ""My son my son"". Think Africa Press saw one killed and at least three injured being carried from the scene following the blast.

'' 'Later in the day as the situation calmed police on hand explained to reporters that the second explosion was likely caused by an unexploded grenade used in the first attack. Saturday\'s high winds and rain somehow triggered the detonation of this grenade.

Indeed many on hand at the scene of the explosion wore shirts declaring support for the RPF as well as the systemic opposition groups the Social Democratic Party and the smaller Liberal and PS-Imberakuri parties. Whilst these opposition parties staged rallies in major Rwandan cities including Kigali and Buye in many rural areas the RPF was the only party campaigning.' '' 'The explosions failed to disrupt the tame but festive mood in Kigali which saw political parties holding rallies passing out t-shirts and chartering buses to circle the city with microphones blaring out political slogans.' '' ""Typical of the mood was a campaign closing dinner held on Sunday night in the modest Eminence Hotel for the supporters of RPF's campaign in Kigali's Nyarugenge district. The singing of political anthems gave way to a round of traditional songs and a small barbeque dinner. The district's mayor and parliamentary candidates gave support for the RPF in which the district leading parliamentary candidate Berkana Eujin stressed the importance of elections for strengthening of democracy. While other speakers at the event also spoke on the importance of maintaining security within the country Musafiri Ley who also campaigned for the RPF in Kigali declined to speculate on whether he would seek constitutional changes that would allow him to seek another term as did other party leaders at the event."" '' 'Election day' '' ""Although the opposition parties' tallies were slightly higher in these polls than in the last set of parliamentary elections to many the elections were already a foregone conclusion when scores flocked to cast their vote on Monday. Many who are unhappy with the rule of the RPF and President Kagame choose to voice their concerns in ways other than the ballot box."" '' 'Nicholas Kato a resident of Kigali who has returned to Rwanda from Uganda where his parents fled in 1960 says he was displeased with the direction with which the country is headed. He says that ""Sure Kagame has brought us security but at what cost? His rule has been direct and overbearing. I don\'t like his style or policies."" Rather than vote for an opposition party however Kato has decided to abstain parliamentary elections.' '' 'Indeed voters who spoke to Think Africa Press prior to the blast and on election day itself listed the maintenance of security as their most pressing concern. Bera Uwamaria explained that ""the success of this country is based on our stability."" ""That is the reason the economy here is better than our neighbours in the DRC"" she says lifting her chin in the vague direction of Rwanda\'s border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.' '' 'Although many are concerned with Kagame\'s record on human rights some are content with the perception that the regime is efficient and that there is a lack of corruption. ""Just a few years ago these streets were filthy; the government is really trying to improve the lives of the people"" explains Fred Ngiruwonsanga. These claims are also to some extent backed up international statistics. Rwanda was ranked 52nd out of 185 countries in the World Bank\'s ease of doing business index for 2013. The country was placed third-most competitive economy in Africa and the economy expanded by 8% last year.'
