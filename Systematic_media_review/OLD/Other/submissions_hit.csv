'' '1923 The League of Nations formally mandates Rwanda to Belgium (Belgian rule lasts until independence in 1962).' '' '1926 Belgians decide that the population of Rwanda should be classified as either Tutsi or Hutu. Unlike in previous times when the Hutu-Tutsi distinction was fluid (prosperous peasants could become Tutsis while Tutsis who fell on hard economic times could suffer reduced social status and become Hutus) this Belgian administrative measure now strictly designates those who own more than ten cows as Tutsi and all others as Hutu with no possibility of movement between the two groups. Imposing a Belgian practice all citizens are issued national identification cards which include an entry for tribe. Thus the complicated hierarchy of pre-colonial times is simplified with more power concentrated at the top and fewer benefits and prerogatives accruing to those at the bottom. In addition Europeans want a uniform territorial system and therefore eliminate the pockets of autonomy which had existed in pre-colonial Rwanda. Some of these autonomous regions are in fact Hutu-controlled further reducing the status of that group and enhancing Tutsi supremacy under European tutelage.' '' '1946 Ruanda-Urundi became a UN trust territory under the administration of Belgium. The Belgians begin developing institutions of self-government among the people.' '' '1951 - 1960 Hutu resistance to the Tutsi monarchy increases as does the movement for independence from Belgium among both Hutus and Tutsis.' '' '1959 The Hutu-Tutsi divide widens as ethnic politics intensify. The Parmehutu (Party for the Emancipation of the Hutu People) is pitted against the monarchist and Tutsi-led UNAR (National Rwandese Union). Belgium suddenly abandons its traditional clients and dispatches paratroopers to extirpate the Tutsi power structure. Clashes between Hutus and Tutsis commence in the north and quickly spread throughout Rwanda. An estimated 10000 Tutsis are killed with perhaps 200000 more fleeing the country.' '' 'Jan 1 - Oct 31 1961 Hutu-led political forces proclaim a Republic and abolish the Tutsi monarchy. A new constitution is drafted. The first Tutsi exile guerrilla group is formed.' '' '1961 - 1970 Tutsi exiles form paramilitary units and mount incursions into Rwanda which target local Hutu officials. Tutsi exiles operate from sanctuaries in Burundi Tanzania Uganda and Zaire. The Hutu government counters Tutsi guerrillas by deploying Belgian paratroopers and by orchestrating reprisal massacres of Tutsis.'

Apparently in response to the unrest in Burundi the Hutu-dominated regime in Rwanda begins a program of expelling Tutsis from positions in government education and business. In addition counter-massacres of Tutsis occur in Rwanda resulting in about 500 deaths.' '' 'Jul 1973 A bloodless military coup is led by Major General Juvenal Habyarimana (a Hutu) who proclaims himself President. Crowds of Hutus (possibly orchestrated by the military) attack Tutsis. Portions of the 1962 constitution are suspended the legislature is dissolved and a more centralized administration is created.

Harkening back to Rwanda\'s militia tradition RPF fighters also refer to themselves as the ""Inkotanyi"" or the ""the indefatigable ones."" Close ties are forged between Ugandan rebel leader Yoweri Museveni\'s National Resistance Army (NRA) and Uganda\'s Tutsi exiles. Thus when Museveni is later installed as Ugandan President political and military debts are owed to the Tutsi exiles.' '' ""1985 From this point forward Rwanda's neighbors (Burundi Uganda Tanzania and Zaire) repeatedly try to negotiate a program of systematic Tutsi repatriation but Rwanda consistently stalls claiming with some justification that there is no land or jobs for returnees (of course Rwanda's neighbors face these same limitations)."" '' '1988 As a result of disorganized rural violence by politically and socially discontented Hutus against local Tutsi officials notables and civilians in the north of Burundi the Tutsi-dominated army conducts unpremeditated massacres of Hutus. Hutu deaths are estimated to be between 5000 and 20000 or as high as 50000. An estimated 50000 Hutus also flee to Rwanda. Almost all of this wave of refugees returned home by the end of the year.' '' 'Oct 1 1990 From this point forward the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invades Rwanda from its bases in Uganda. In response the Rwandan security service distributes arms to local civilian officials. Eventually the army is increased in size to as many as 50000 effectives. RPF forces are almost exclusively made up of Tutsi fighters with a few Hutus in showcase ""political"" positions. However in a statement to the press the RPF denies that it is waging an ethnic war against the government but instead describes their goals as merely political in nature. Habyarimana\'s National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND) is divided between a hardline faction which opposes accommodation with the Tutsi rebels and a smaller conciliatory faction. There are reports that the government has arrested Tutsi businessmen teachers and priests as collaborators with the rebels. It is particularly significant that the government labels resident Tutsis with no connection to the RPF as rebel ""accomplices."" In fact many Tutsis initially support the government against the RPF but the regime decisively rebuffs them. Habyarimana admits that elite Zairian troops are helping to neutralize the RPF offensive. Habyarimana skillfully draws France directly into the conflict by staging a mock RPF ""attack"" on the capital thus deceiving foreign journalists and diplomats into believing that the rebels are on the verge of overthrowing his government. France as well as Belgium quickly dispatches contingents to bolster the internal security of Rwanda. Anti-Tutsi French political and military officials refer to the RPF as the ""Khmers Rouges"" of Africa. Belgium cuts off military aid to Rwanda after RPF offensive but it still furnishes the government with non-lethal aid.' '' 'Nov 1990 The RPF invasion is repulsed by government forces. President Habyarimana announces that he will allow multi-party politics commencing in 1991. Perhaps more importantly for settling the Hutu-Tutsi issue he also declares that the practice of specifying ethnicity on the national identification card will cease although this measure is never implemented. The World Bank loans Rwanda 80 million dollars to help solve chronic economic problems and calm heated political conditions brought on by the RPF invasion six weeks earlier.' '' '1991 The US Department of State Human Rights Report for 1991 notes that up to 200 Tutsi civilians are killed in random attacks carried out by Rwandan army units and Hutu civilians. These killings are perpetrated in the northern provinces of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri the two districts most directly threatened by RPF rebels.'

'' 'Jun 1991 Habyarimana signs a new Constitution which provides for multi-party politics the creation of a prime ministership a limited Presidential term (a candidate could seek a maximum of two terms of five years each) and separate executive judicial and legislative branches of government.' '' 'Jul 1 1991 From this point forward a new Political Parties Law goes into effect. It bans parties based on ethnicity or religious affiliation. Shortly thereafter five new political parties are legally registered and by the beginning of 1992 this figure rises to twelve. Although large street rallies are held demanding political changes there is no indication that the non-RPF opposition to Habyarimana is militant (for example they do not acquire guns or train for insurgency).' '' 'Aug 1991 The Justice Minister announces that an initiative is underway to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda. The release of 5500 people arrested following the RPF invasion of 1990 is announced.' '' 'Sep 1991 Belgium grants Rwanda 5.6 million dollars to support a structural adjustment program. Among other purposes the funds are to be used to train Rwandan journalists in Belgium as the first step in establishing a television network based in Kigali. At this time Belgium also announces that it will furnish Rwanda with additional food aid.' '' '1992 Habyarimana makes a series of visits to Mobutu of Zaire and Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo for advice on how to maintain his power. On their advice Habyarimana maneuvers to split two key opposition parties (one of which was composed of both Hutus and Tutsis) thus polarizing the political situation and promoting tribalism.'

'' ""Mar 14 1992 Three of the largest opposition parties (the Rwanda Democratic Movement Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party) and Habyarimana's own MRND agree to form an interim coalition government."" '' ""Apr 1992 A continuing political crisis forces Habyarimana to agree to include two more opposition parties in his government. In addition to the RPF campaign the following developments contribute to the mounting political stress placed on Habyarimana: protest marches by four opposition parties (carried out in January in Kigali and Butare and threatened in March); a threat by Habyarimana's only coalition partner the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) to resign from the government (February); pressure from Catholic and Protestant Church leaders to grant a share of power to opposition parties; domestic press criticism (prompting the government to arrest at least two prominent Rwandan journalists); and criticism of Habyarimana's regime in the international press (including a March 1992 charge by a scholar with France's scientific research center CNRS that Rwanda is practicing genocide against Tutsis). Under the April agreement the prime ministership goes to an opposition party thus ending two decades of effective political monopoly by Habyarimana and his movement."" '' 'Jun 1992 Rwandan (Hutu) soldiers go on rampages in several districts as the appointed date for cease-fire talks approaches. Habyarimana announces that he intends to restructure the armed forces following widespread looting by troops who fear that they will be demobilized if a peace agreement is reached with rebels. In addition the President announces that the army and gendarmerie commanders as well as four other colonels will be retired.' '' 'Jul 1992 In negotiations conducted under OAU auspices and attended by Western and regional diplomats both the Rwandan government and RPF rebels agree that a neutral group of OAU military observers will monitor a cease-fire. The OAU group consists of 50 members drawn from the armed forces of Zimbabwe Senegal and Nigeria with logistical support provided by Belgium France Germany and the United States. Amid much wrangling by various member states on the propriety of this action and due to the manifest lack of effectiveness of the observer team the OAU force is later withdrawn.' '' ""Aug 1992 The regime and RPF rebels agree on sweeping political reforms and the formation of an interim government which will include substantial RPF representation. Rwanda and Uganda sign a security pact aimed at ending tensions over Uganda's alleged aid to Rwanda's RPF rebels. Troops from Zaire fighting in Rwanda against rebels are withdrawn.""

Despite the democracy-friendly name of this new umbrella group Habyarimana has now forged a united front with the most radical anti-Tutsi elements in the Hutu political spectrum.' '' ""Jan 1993 The government signs a power-sharing agreement with the opposition however nine Hutu MRND ministers issue a statement saying that the MRND should not accept the minority role assigned to it under the accord. In addition in an official statement the MRND accuses Rwanda's Foreign Minister of treason for signing an agreement with the RPF. At the same time moderate elements of the Hutu power structure lobby for a more comprehensive settlement with the rebels."" '' '1993 Habyarimana\'s regime begins to train militia cadres known as the ""Interahamwe"" (or ""those who attack together"") and the ""Impuzamugambi"" (translated as ""single minded-ones"" or ""those who have the same goal""). The Interahamwe eventually the largest and most deadly militia are Hutus recruited from the youth wing of the President\'s MRND. Similarly the Impuzamugambi are drawn from the youth wing of the CDR. The Hutu militias reportedly receive training by the army and are furnished with grenades and AK-47 rifles as well as machetes knives clubs and bows and arrows. Other observers suggest that the French may provide direct or indirect training to the militias when they are in camps in the northeast of the country. Deployed throughout the Rwanda the MRND and CDR militias commit massacres at the behest of both local Hutu officials and central Hutu authorities. In mid-March 1993 the militias are ordered to stand down by the government but their network remains in place for speedy reactivation.' '' 'Feb 8 1993 Breaking a cease-fire the RPF launches major incursions into Rwanda from Uganda (on February 14 up to 600 rebels cross the border).' '' ""Mar 24 1993 In response to a harsh report by a human rights panel Habyarimana denies that any massacres have taken place since he took office. Habyarimana blames violence on the insurgency exclusively and denied ethnicity was a factor in Rwanda's problems. Ethnic problems will end when the war ends the President says."" '' 'Jul 1993 The Prime Minister lashes out at President Habyarimana for failing to sign a peace treaty with the RPF.' '' ""Aug 1993 At Arusha in Tanzania a new comprehensive accord is concluded between Habyarimana and the RPF. A coalition government is promised featuring a Hutu Prime Minister and a 21 member cabinet with five Tutsis. The military forces and RPF troops are to merge creating a new Rwandan army. The reformed officer corps is to be split equally between Tutsis and Hutus with 60 percent of the troops recruited from government forces and 40 percent from the RPF. All refugees are to be allowed to return and multi-party elections are promised for mid-1995. Vocal elements of Habyarimana's MRND denounce the Arusha accords as does the Committee for the Defense of the Republic (CDR) a Hutu extremist organization closely allied with (and perhaps controlled by) the MRND. There are reports that the government (in violation of agreements) is distributing arms to its supporters."" '' ""Nov 1993 A UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) is deployed consisting of 2500 troops to monitor the Arusha accords reached between the RPF and Habyarimana in August. However the ineffectiveness of this force is soon apparent. The UN force's mandate is peace-keeping not peace-making hence it can not actively intervene to prevent killings. In addition it is composed of more than 20 different nationalities each with its own language few of whom can speak French."" '' ""Jan 1994 Another power sharing agreement is signed between the government and the RPF. Under the terms of this settlement Habyarimana's MRND receives six of 22 government offices including the positions of Prime Minister and Defense Minister and the RPF is to receive five portfolios including Deputy Prime Minister and Interior. Remaining cabinet posts are to go to other parties. The organization Human Rights Watch issues a comprehensive report entitled Arming Rwanda which documents the extent of Rwandan involvement in the international arms trade.

Clashes among his supporters and their hardline Hutu political rivals in the CDR ensue. Youths associated with the CDR target government opponents both Tutsis and Hutu moderates for beatings and killings.

The Presidential Guard in Kigali and army and militia elements in other parts of Rwanda begin attacking Tutsis and Hutus who are believed to be political opponents of the regime. The official government position is that RPF forces in the capital staged attacks on the Presidential Guard. After the massacres begin the government describes the violence as a spontaneous ""popular uprising"" against Tutsis in revenge for their support of the RPF and its assassination of Habyarimana. Government radio calls on Hutus to kill Tutsis. With the targeting of moderate Hutus for extermination the RPF for the first time is able to recruit appreciable numbers of Hutus into its ranks. By mid-1994 due to civil war and genocide Rwandan society is in a state of complete collapse: at least 500000 people killed between April and July approximately two million refugees abroad and one million internally displaced people the cessation of business and agricultural activities the death or flight of the educated and talented and the breakdown of routine government activity including legal educational and health operations.

Training by elite troops of the French Foreign Legion took place between 1990-1993.' '' 'Apr 17 1998 The RPA reportedly killed more than 70 Hutu militiamen in northern Gitarama. A military commander in the area said the rebels were part of a group of more than 100 Hutus who are thought to be behind an upsurge in killings in northwestern and central Rwanda. In the past two weeks more than 190 people have been killed  and much of Rwanda is a no-go zone. Locals in the Gisenyi area have fled.' '' 'Apr 24 1998 Rwanda executed four people convicted of crimes of genocide. There are currently over 130000 people detained in prisons in the country. Since December 1996 only 300 have been tried and 130 have been sentenced to death. No judgements have been issued to date at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha Tanzania.' '' 'May 2 1998 Former Rwandan Prime Minister Jean Kambanda entered a guilty plea to six charges of genocide and crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha.' '' 'May 4 1998 Suspected Hutu militiamen killed 10 people including a mother and her six children in Ruhengeri Prefecture in two separate incidents.' '' 'May 18 1998 The Rwandan government gave a hostile reception to Kofi Annan as he visited Rwanda. The parliament expected Annan to apologize on behalf of the United Nations for not intervening to stop the 1994 genocide. Massacres in 1959 1963 and 1973 were also ignored by the international body.' '' 'Jun 23 1998 Seth Sendashonga a liberal Hutu opposition leader living in Kenya was assassinated. Rwandan government agents were suspected though the government blamed Hutu rivalry for his death. The assassination sent many exiled Hutus into hiding. Over 1 million Hutu refugees have returned to Rwanda since the end of 1996 but those in Kenya and Tanzania have stayed put.' '' 'Jun 24 1998 Amnesty International released another report on the human rights situation in Rwanda. It reported that the conflict had worsened that there is a steady flow of arms into the country and that both the government and Hutu rebels deliberately kill civilians on a regular basis. The escalation of the conflict including the killing and disappearance of civilians began with the return of a million refugees from the former Zaire at the end of 1996. The violence is especially bad in Gisenyi and Ruhengeri in the northwest and Gitarama in Central Rwanda. In many cases the armed rebels have been killing Hutus and Tutsis without distinction targeting anyone suspected of collaborating with the government.']",tutsi dominant area comprises modern rwanda

"['What makes Dominican Republic a unique country to travel to?' '' 'Country Description' '' 'The Dominican Republic covers the eastern two-thirds of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. The capital city is Santo Domingo located on the south coast of the island. Tourist facilities vary according to price and location. Spanish is the official language. Though English is widely spoken in major cities and tourist areas it is much less common outside these areas.' '' 'Crime' '' ""Crime continues to be a problem throughout the Dominican Republic. Street crime and petty theft involving U.S. tourists does occur and you should take precautions to avoid becoming a target. While pick pocketing and mugging are the most common crimes against tourists reports of violence against both foreigners and locals are growing. Valuables left unattended in parked automobiles on beaches and in other public places are vulnerable to theft and car theft remains a problem.Travelers to the Dominican Republic should strongly consider leaving valuable property at home. We recommend bringing no item on your trip that cannot be easily replaced and to make contingency plans in case of theft. These precautions include: making photocopies of all credit cards and licenses which include the numbers to call in order to report theft; photocopies of passports and birth certificates; and leaving emergency funds with someone at home in case it is necessary for money to be sent on short notice.Carry cellular telephones in a pocket rather than on a belt or in a purse. Avoid wearing headphones which make the bearer more vulnerable and readily advertise the presence of a valuable item. Limit or avoid display of jewelry; it attracts attention and could prompt a robbery attempt. Limit cash and credit cards carried on your person. Be sure to store valuables wallet items and passports in a safe place.There are continuing reports of thefts that target tourists en route from the airport to their hotel or home. Some U.S. citizens have been victimized in taxis. In a typical case a taxi with rolled-down windows stops at a traffic light and a motorcyclist reaches in and steals a purse or other valuables. You are advised to utilize the taxi service authorized by the airport if you did not make arrangements before arrival. Even when using such an authorized taxi service you should always be aware of the potential for a criminal to stalk travelers leaving the airport parking area. Motorcyclists have also been known to steal purses or jewelry of pedestrians. U.S. citizens in privately owned vehicles have also been targeted and you should always keep doors and windows locked and be aware of your surroundings to deter criminals. Some travelers returning to local residences in privately owned vehicles have been followed assaulted and robbed upon arrival at their home. Several U.S. citizens have also been targeted and robbed at bus stations possibly as a result of gang activity. Take measures to safeguard your personal security at all times.The dangers present in the Dominican Republic are similar to those of many major U.S. cities. Criminals can be dangerous -- many have weapons and are likely to use them if they meet resistance. Visitors walking the streets should always be aware of their surroundings. Be wary of strangers especially those who seek you out at celebrations or nightspots. Travel with a partner or in a group if possible.Many public transportation vehicles are unsafe especially the route taxis or “carros publicos” in urban areas. These are privately owned cars that run along certain routes can take up to six or more passengers and are inexpensive. Passengers in “carros publicos” are frequently the victims of pick pocketing and passengers have on occasion been robbed by “carro publico” drivers. Urban buses (“guaguas”) are only marginally better. We are also aware of at least one incident in which the driver of a “motoconcho” (motorcycle taxi) robbed a U.S. citizen passenger. The U.S. Embassy cautions its staff not to use these modes of transportation. As an alternative some scheduled interurban bus services use modern buses and run on reliable timetables. These are generally the safest means of intercity travel. With respect to taxis visitors to the Dominican Republic are strongly advised to take only hotel taxis or taxis operated by services whose cabs are arranged in advance by phone and can subsequently be identified and tracked. Drivers should exercise extreme caution when driving at night and use major highways when possible. There was a case of a U.S. citizen riding her moped who was stopped and robbed on a rural road near Samana. Although kidnappings are not common in the Dominican Republic U.S. citizens have been kidnapped and held for ransom in the past.The U.S. Embassy calls attention to certain criminal techniques that have surprised U.S. citizens and other victims in recent years:Several individuals reported robberies perpetrated by criminals on mopeds (often coasting with the engine turned off so as not to draw attention). The driver approaches a pedestrian grabs his or her cell phone purse or backpack and then speeds away. This type of robbery is particularly dangerous because the motorcyclist reaches the intended victim at 15–20 miles per hour and often knocks the victim to the ground.The Embassy has received reports of crime involving apparent police collaboration. A seemingly-friendly stranger shakes hands with a tourist who then finds that the stranger has placed a small baggie of cocaine or other substance into the tourist’s hand. The tourist is then immediately apprehended by a police officer and pays a “fine” to the police to be set free.U.S. citizens have been victimized at the airports in Santo Domingo and Punta Cana as they checked in their luggage and prepared to leave the country. Smugglers obtained an authentic airline baggage tag in a U.S. citizen’s name and placed it on baggage that contained drugs presumably to be retrieved by an accomplice at the other end of the flight.Criminals may also misrepresent themselves in an effort to gain access to your residence or hotel room. In one case Dominican police arrested a building’s maintenance man and an accomplice for a violent crime against a U.S. citizen. There have been instances when U.S. citizens were robbed of large amounts of cash immediately prior to a scheduled financial transaction by thieves with apparent inside knowledge of the transaction. In one case a U.S. citizen was robbed just outside his attorney’s office and in another case a U.S. citizen reported he was victimized by two police officers.U.S. citizens residing in private homes have been the victims of robberies sometimes resulting in fatal violence. In one case an elderly couple in San Pedro de Macoris was violently assaulted in their home and the husband murdered. In another case a home in Puerto Plata was broken into and the visiting U.S. citizen occupants assaulted tied up and robbed. In still another case two elderly U.S. citizens in Santiago were robbed and attacked in their home with a machete. One died and the other was hospitalized with critical injuries.The U.S. Embassy continues to receive reports from U.S. citizens who have been stopped while driving and asked for “donations” by someone who may appear to be a police officer before they are allowed to continue on their way. Usually the person(s) stopping the U.S. citizen drivers had approached from behind on a motorcycle; several of these motorcyclists pulled up alongside the driver's window and indicated that they were carrying a firearm. In some cases the perpetrators were dressed in the light green uniform of “AMET” the Dominican traffic police; however they often seemed too young to be police officers or wore ill-fitting uniforms that might have been stolen. In another incident individuals dressed in military fatigues told the victim they were police and requested the victim to follow them to the police station prior to robbing him. Such incidents should be reported to the police and to the Consular Section. If Dominican police stop you for a traffic violation you should request a traffic ticket rather than paying an on-the-spot fine. You also have the right to ask police for identification. Regulations require police to wear a nametag with their last name. While everyone driving in the Dominican Republic should abide by traffic laws and the instructions of legitimate authorities U.S. citizens finding themselves in the aforementioned scenarios should exercise caution. In general you should keep your doorslocked and windows closed at all times and leave yourself an escape route when stopping in traffic in the event of an accident or other threat. Incidents involving police may be reported to the Internal Affairs Department of the National Police at 809-688-0777.You should use credit cards judiciously while in the Dominican Republic. Credit card fraud is common and recent reports indicate that its incidence has increased significantly in Santo Domingo as well as in the resort areas of the country.If you elect to use your credit or debit cards you should never let the cards leave your sight. You should also pay close attention to credit card bills following time spent in the Dominican Republic. There have been reports of fraudulent charges appearing months after card usage in the Dominican Republic. Victims of credit card fraud should contact the bank that issued the credit card immediately.Minimize the use of automated teller machines (ATMs) which are present throughout Santo Domingo and other major cities. One local ATM fraud scheme involves sticking photographic film or pieces of paper in the card feeder of the ATM so that an inserted card becomes jammed. Once the card owner has concluded the card is irretrievable the thieves extract both the jamming material and the card which they then use. There are other more sophisticated ATM scams as well including operations that involve “insiders” who can access and manipulate electronic data entered by legitimate card holders at properly functioning ATMs. Exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings when using an ATM card.The overall level of crime tends to rise during the Christmas season and you should take extra precautions when visiting the Dominican Republic between November and January.Beaches and Resorts: The Embassy regularly receives reports of individuals and families who have become victims of crime while within the boundaries of their resort hotel. A growing number of these crimes involve the burglary of the room and even the removal of the room safe. In general the criminals do not commit their crime in the presence of the guest but it is not unheard of for guests to be victimized in their own room caught off guard in their sleep. We strongly recommend vigilance. Hotels generally will not assume responsibility for valuables left in a room.The Embassy has become increasingly aware of overly aggressive and dishonest merchants along the beaches in front of resort hotels. The Dominican Government has been trying to improve oversight of these merchants but has not made visible progress to date.The Embassy has received numerous reports of instances of sexual assault at the resorts particularly while at the beach. Some hotel employees have ingratiated themselves with guests as a ruse to ultimately isolate and force the victim into compromising circumstances. Many hotels have policies that discourage employee fraternization with guests. Please report any unwanted attention you receive to hotel management. Be aware of cultural differences and stay in the company of your traveling companions. It has also been reported that some predators will use date rape drugs or take advantage of alcohol consumption to render their victims unaware. Be cautious of accepting any drink or food from a stranger as it may have been tampered with. Again the Embassy strongly encourages vigilance. “All-inclusive” resorts are well known for serving abundant quantities of alcohol and there are no laws in the Dominican Republic against serving alcohol to intoxicated persons. Drink responsibly. Remember that excessive alcohol consumption may decrease your awareness of your surroundings making you an easy target for crime.If you become a victim of sexual assault and another violent crime we urge you to report the incident immediately to the Embassy’s American Citizen Services Unit during working hours or to the U.S. Embassy’s duty officer after hours. You should also report the incident to local authorities for a police report. It is essential that sexual assault victims insist on an immediate examination by an authorized police medical examiner (medica legista) to ensure that a documented report is available for any future prosecution of the case.Please be aware that crime can happen anywhere and that everyone must take personal responsibility to stay alert of their surroundings at all times. Read the U.S. Embassy’s security tips for more information.The Embassy also receives reports of individuals who have suffered accidents or medical crisis at resorts. Check your insurance coverage prior to going overseas or consider travelers’ insurance. Hospitalization in the Dominican Republic can be extremely expensive and patients are expected to pay for services immediately. For additional information see the section below on medical insurance.Don’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States if you purchase them you may also be breaking local law.Tourist Police: The Dominican Republic has police that are specially trained to assist tourists who require assistance. This public institution is called Politur and represents a cooperative effort between the National Police Secretary of the Armed Forces and the Secretary of Tourism. Politur typically has personnel in tourist areas to provide first responder type assistance to tourists. If you are the victim of a crime Politur can help you get to a police station so that you may file a police report and seek further assistance. Politur is located at the corner of 30 de Marzo and Mexico Bloque D Governmental Building Santo Domingo. The general phone number is 809-221-8697."" '' 'Criminal Penalties' '' 'While you are traveling in the Dominican Republic you are subject to its laws even if you are a U.S. citizen. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different than our own. In some places you may be questioned if you don’t have your passport with you. In some places driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. These criminal penalties will vary from country to country. There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit but still illegal in the United States and you can be prosecuted under U.S. law if you buy pirated goods.Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime prosecutable in the United States as well as the Dominican Republic. If you break local laws in the Dominican Republic your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not where you are going.Persons violating laws of the Dominican Republic even unknowingly may be expelled arrested or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing using or trafficking in illegal drugs in the Dominican Republic are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.Arrest notifications in host country: Based on the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations bilateral agreements with certain countries and customary international law if you are arrested in the Dominican Republic you have the option to request that the police prison officials or other authorities alert the nearest U.S. Embassy of your arrest and to have communications from you forwarded to the U.S. Embassy.' '' 'Medical Facilities and Health Information' '' ""While adequate medical facilities can be found in large cities particularly in private hospitals the quality of care can vary greatly outside major population centers. There is an emergency 911 service within Santo Domingo but its reliability is questionable. Outside the capital emergency services range from extremely limited to nonexistent. Blood supplies at both public and private hospitals are often limited and not all facilities have blood on hand even for emergencies. Many medical facilities throughout the country do not have staff members who speak or understand English. A private nationwide ambulance service ProMed operates in Santo Domingo Santiago Puerto Plata and La Romana; the telephone number is 809-412-5555. ProMed expects full payment at the time of transport.Consult closely with your medical practitioner in the United States regarding any locally available treatments or therapies before traveling to the Dominican Republic for procedures which are not licensed and approved in the United States. Experimental procedures carry certain risks as the quality of treatment varies from U.S. standards.The U.S. Embassy maintains a non-comprehensive list of medical providers in the Dominican Republic. The availability of prescription drugs varies depending upon location. Also specific brand name drugs may not be available in the Dominican Republic. There have been some instances of counterfeit drugs infiltrating the Dominican market. You are advised to make sure you are traveling with an adequate supply of prescription drugs to meet your needs while in the Dominican Republic.Tap water is unsafe to drink and should be avoided. Bottled water and beverages are considered safe.Dengue: Dengue is endemic to the Dominican Republic. To reduce the risk of contracting dengue the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing clothing that exposes as little skin as possible and applying a repellent containing the insecticide DEET (concentration 30 to 35 percent) or Picaridin (concentration 20 percent or greater for tropical travelers). Because of the increased risk of dengue fever and the ongoing risk of malaria in the Dominican Republic (see below) practicing preventative measures is recommended by the CDC. Forfurther information on dengue fever please visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's website.Cholera: According to the Dominican Republic's Ministry of Health more than 15000 suspected cases of cholera and 262 related deaths have been reported throughout the country from November 2010 to early 2013. Several cases have been reported in travelers returning from Punta Cana resorts. Cholera vaccine available in many countries but not in the U.S. is recommended for aid and refugee workers only. Extreme care in hygiene and food habits for travel to risk areas including resort areas is advised. Carry oral rehydration salts in case of severe watery diarrhea. Azithromycin is recommended for diarrhea self-treatment; the epidemic strain of Vibrio cholerae has reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.Malaria: There are occasional reports of cases of malaria in areas frequented by U.S. and European tourists including La Altagracia Province the easternmost province in which many beach resorts are located. Malaria risk is significantly higher for travelers who go on some of the excursions to the countryside offered by many resorts. Prior to visiting the Dominican Republic travelers should consult the CDC web site for more information on malaria.Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Be aware that sexually transmitted diseases are common in the Dominican Republic. Please take appropriate precautions to help stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.Cosmetic Surgery: The U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo and the CDC are aware of several cases in which U.S. citizens experienced serious complications or died following elective cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic. The CDC's Website contains a report on patients who suffered postoperative infections following cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic. Patients considering travel to the Dominican Republic for cosmetic surgery may also wish to contact the Dominican Society of Plastic Surgeons (tel. 809-688-8451) to verify the training qualifications and reputation of specific doctors. Note that some plastic surgeons continue to practice after patients have died during or after cosmetic surgery procedures so the U.S. Embassy urges strong caution when considering cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic. Please note there is no regulatory authority governing claims that some doctors or clinics make on their websites."" '' 'Safety and Security' '' ""Foreign tourists are often considered attractive targets for criminal activity and you should maintain a low profile to avoid becoming a victim of violence or crime. In dealing with local police you should be aware that the standard of professionalism might vary. Police attempts to solicit bribes have been reported as have incidents of police using excessive force.Protests demonstrations and general strikes occur periodically. Previous political demonstrations have sometimes turned violent with participants rioting and erecting roadblocks and police sometimes using deadly force in response. Political demonstrations do not generally occur in areas frequented by tourists and are generally not targeted at foreigners. However it is advisable to exercise caution when traveling throughout the country. Street crowds should be avoided. In urban areas travel should be conducted on main routes whenever possible. Power outages occur frequently throughout the Dominican Republic and travelers should remain alert during blackout periods as crime rates often increase during these outages.If you are considering overland travel between the Dominican Republic and Haiti you should first consult the Country Specific Information page the Travel Warning for Haiti and the Messages for U.S. citizens page on the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince's website for information about travel conditions in Haiti. While Santo Domingo and the majority of the tourist destinations within the Dominican Republic are located several hours from the Haitian border the January 12 2010 earthquake in Haiti has contributed to increased congestion in the area between Barahona Dominican Republic and the Haitian border along route 44. There were two incidents involving attacks against U.S. citizen relief workers as they traveled from Haiti to Santo Domingo. In both cases the U.S. citizens observed common safety practices such as traveling in a large group and in conjunction with other vehicles. Despite the extra precautions the groups were attacked. In one incident armed men blocked the highway with burning tires and opened fire on a passing bus. The armed men also shattered a bus window with a rock and the bus driver was forced to ram the burning blockade in order to escape to safety. In another incident armed gunmen and men with machetes detained a group of U.S. citizen relief workers for several hours.The U.S. Embassy cautions its staff to use extreme caution while in Haiti. Other than official business travel to Haiti for U.S. Embassy personnel is discouraged. The Department of State has issued a Travel Warning for Haiti. U.S. citizens who travel to Haiti despite this Warning especially in the area along route 44 near the border of Haiti should travel in groups during daylight hours and use caution. Drivers who encounter illegal roadblocks should stop a significant distance away drive in reverse or turn around and drive to the nearest town to report the blockade to local authorities. Drivers should do their best to leave the danger zone and get to safety."" '' 'Traffic Safety and Road Conditions' '' 'While in the Dominican Republic you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning the Dominican Republic is provided for general reference only.Traffic in the Dominican Republic moves on the right side of the road. Speed limits vary from 25 mph in the city to 60 mph on rural roads but they are generally not enforced. Drivers are required to carry liability insurance.If you do drive in the Dominican Republic you should be aware that the utmost caution and defensive driving are necessary. Traffic laws are similar to those in the United States but undisciplined driving is common due to a lack of adequate traffic controls. Many drivers will not use turn indicators. It is common for a vehicle operator to stick his hand out the window to signal a turn. Drivers can also be aggressive and erratic often failing to yield the right-of-way even when road signs or signals indicate that they should. Turning right on red lights is permitted but should be done with caution.Travel at night on intercity highways and in rural areas should be avoided due to animals on the road poor road conditions poor lane markers missing manhole covers large potholes unmarked speed bumps and other vehicles being driven at excessive speeds often with malfunctioning headlights or taillights. Drivers should be aware that road hazards and closures are often indicated by piles of debris littered across the roadway without any lettered signs or reflective surfaces to help call attention to the road condition. Often times there is no indication of the road hazard whatsoever. Blackouts also increase the danger of night travel. Mudslides and bridge washouts can be a problem during and after heavy rains. The distances between reliable roadside services or major population centers can be considerable which also increases the risk involved in driving after dark.Traffic accidents often result in serious injury or death. This is often the case when heavy vehicles such as buses or trucks are involved. Traditionally vehicles involved in accidents in the Dominican Republic are not moved (even to clear traffic) until authorized by a police officer. Drivers who violate this norm may be held legally liable for the accident.Dominican law requires that a driver be taken into custody for driving under the influence or being involved in an accident that causes serious injury or death even if the driver is insured and appears not to have been at fault. The minimum detention period is 48 hours; however detentions frequently last until a judicial decision is reached (often weeks or months) or until a waiver is signed by the injured party (usually as the result of a cash settlement).Visitors to the Dominican Republic might want to consider hiring a professional driver during their stay in lieu of driving themselves. Licensed drivers who are familiar with local roads can be hired through local car rental agencies. In case of accidents only the driver will be taken into custody.Pedestrians tend to step out into traffic without regard to corners crosswalks or traffic signals. Many pedestrians die every year crossing the street (including major multi-lane highways) at seemingly random locations. Pedestrians do not have the right-of-way and walking along or crossing busy streets – even at intersections with traffic lights or traffic police present – can be very dangerous.Seat belts are required by law and those caught not wearing them will be fined. There are no child car seat laws. The law also requires the use of hands-free cellular devices while driving. Police stop drivers using cell phones without the benefit of these devices. Penalties for those driving under the influence and those involved in accidents resulting in injury or death can be severe.Motorcycles and motor scooters are common in the Dominican Republic and they are often driven erratically. Dominican law requires that motorcyclists wear helmets but local authorities rarely enforce this law. Motor vehicle authorities report that less than one percent of motorcyclists in the country are actually licensed. As noted previously public transportation vehicles such as the route taxis (“carros publicos”) and urban buses (“guaguas”) are unsafe.']",make dominican republic unique country travel country

['FOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA: Secretary Blinken members of the press good morning. I would like to start by welcoming Secretary Blinken and his delegation to Kigali. And this visit is an opportunity to enhance bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Rwanda and discuss matters of mutual interest.' '' 'Earlier today His Excellency the President of Rwanda received Secretary Blinken and his delegation. We had productive discussions about the partnership between our two countries. At the bilateral level we appreciated our substantial cooperation in various sectors including defense and security trade and investment peacekeeping and health. The Government of Rwanda appreciates the significant support of the U.S. Government in the fight against COVID-19 in Rwanda where the U.S. Government contributed more than 5 million doses of vaccines and 100 medical ventilators to Rwanda. The U.S. continues to be indeed a strong partner in Rwanda’s efforts to build a strong and resilient health system.' '' 'We are also very pleased with our cooperation in the defense sector. Our military cooperation has continued to grow and we were happy to co-host with the U.S. the 11th Annual African Air Chiefs Symposium earlier this year in Kigali.' '' 'We also discussed the security in eastern DRC the very real consequences for Rwanda and reaffirmed our support to regional efforts including the Nairobi and the Luanda initiatives toward peace and stability in our region. We agreed on the need to eradicate all illegal armed groups operating in eastern DRC including the FDLR and its factions. We noted the resurgence of hate speech public incitement and genocidal ideology in DRC and the need to address this issue. We also reaffirmed the importance of respect of territorial integrity by all the countries in the region.' '' 'At the global level this visit was an occasion to discuss the consequences of the war in Ukraine on Africa and Rwanda in particular. We look forward to working with the U.S. Government on addressing the challenges we are facing in relation to the consequences of this conflict.' '' 'Once again we are happy to host you Secretary Blinken and your delegation in Rwanda and we look forward to continuing our work together and strengthening our partnership with the U.S. Thank you.' '' 'SECRETARY BLINKEN: Mr. Minister thank you very much and thank you for hosting our delegation today.' '' 'A few days ago in South Africa I set out our administration’s new Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa a strategy that recognizes African nations and peoples as equal and vital partners in advancing our shared priorities tackling together global challenges and being able to deliver for our citizens.' '' 'You see those same goals reflected in the relationship between Rwanda and the United States. The journey that Rwanda has taken over the past two decades has been remarkable. You’ve risen from the ashes of genocide to become a global destination for innovation for investment for tourism. You lead internationally on priorities that we share: making critical contributions to the United Nations and regional peacekeeping missions; speaking up for Ukraine’s right to sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion; co-sponsoring a resolution at the United Nations to start negotiations on a legally binding global agreement on plastic pollution – with scores of countries’ support including the United States.' '' 'And our two countries have worked closely together on the issues that matter a great deal to Rwanda’s future: improving the quality of your health care system; strengthening your agricultural production and food security; expanding economic opportunities; bolstering the education system so that Rwandan youth are empowered to seize opportunities in the 21st century economy.' '' 'In partnership with COVAX as the minister mentioned the United States has donated more than five and a half million doses of safe and effective vaccines to Rwanda which has helped the country vaccinate nearly 70 percent – fully vaccinate nearly 70 percent of its population.' '' 'In the last six years we’ve helped more than 2.8 million Rwandans get access to electricity for the first time – electricity generated using renewable energy.' '' 'So the relationship between our peoples is deep and diverse as is evident in the collaboration between Rwandan and American nongovernmental organizations students entrepreneurs doctors and others.' '' 'As the foreign minister said we just came from a meeting with President Kagame where we covered a wide range of issues including many of the ones that I’ve just discussed. I also raised issues where we have real concerns. On those our discussions were direct candid respectful. The president candidly conveyed his views as well. I discussed the credible reports indicating that Rwanda continues to support the M23 rebel group and has its armed forces inside the DRC. We recognize that Rwanda has security concerns of its own including reports of cooperation between the Congolese military and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda the DFLR an armed group.' '' 'My message to both President Tshisekedi and President Kagame this week has been the same: any support or cooperation with any armed group in eastern DRC endangers local communities and regional stability. And every country in the region must respect the territorial integrity of the others. The United States has the same message for all neighboring countries.' '' 'We’ve seen where the failure to respect these principles can lead in the immeasurable consequences of the decades-long conflict in eastern DRC which has taken the lives of more than 5 million people and displaced millions more.' '' 'Coming out of the discussions both presidents have agreed to engage in direct talks with each other. They’re both ready to resume the talks in the context of the Nairobi Process with armed groups and both welcome the continued U.S. engagement in support of African-led mediation efforts.' '' 'We know that Rwandans are also alarmed – justifiably – by the increase in hate speech in the DRC targeting Rwandaphones. The United States will continue to condemn such unacceptable and dangerous rhetoric and I encouraged President Tshisekedi his government to do the same.' '' 'Leaders in the region – particularly Kenya and Angola – are working hard to lower tensions and address the problem of armed groups in the eastern Congo. We’re deeply grateful for these efforts. These initiatives are crucial for getting the actors to resolve their differences peacefully through diplomacy rather than through violence and to address the underlying drivers of the conflict.' '' 'In our discussions I also raised serious concerns about human rights. As I told President Kagame we believe people in every country should be able to express their views without fear of intimidation imprisonment violence or any other forms of repression. That’s true whether they are political opponents human rights defenders journalists like the ones in this audience or simply citizens. These are values cherished by the American people and people around the world; that’s why I raised them as have members of the U.S. Congress.' '' 'I raised the case of Paul Rusesabagina who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States and underscored our concerns about the lack of fair trial guarantees provided to him.' '' 'Later today I’ll have an opportunity to visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial. It will provide a chance to reflect on the unimaginable horrors of the genocide which reverberate to this day; to reaffirm the importance of standing up rather than standing by in the face of atrocities; and to ask ourselves what history teaches us about the need to prevent hatred and fear from taking hold again and squandering the progress the people of Rwanda have made since that time.' '' 'We have the deepest admiration for the people of Rwanda their courage their resilience all that they have built. And we hope the conversations we’ve had today will help our partnership grow even stronger.' '' 'Finally Mr. Minister if you would indulge me just a point of personal privilege as we say back in the United States. One of the most important tools in our arsenal is the power of the spoken word – what we say both at home and on the world stage. In the past 18 months our voice my voice has been shaped and sharpened by our chief speechwriter Megan Rooney. I raise this now because Megan will soon be leaving the department. Others’ gain is our profound loss and that loss is especially pronounced when it comes to me. Not only is she a master wordsmith who can make what can sometimes be a dry policy soar she’s a wonderful person. Kind. Funny. Fun to be around. To put her in the vernacular she brings a trademark joie de vivre which has been a light for me and our entire team especially the case when we’re traveling around the world.' '' 'So Megan thank you thank you thank you and I’ll end by saying that going forward should I happen to say something I don’t know less than artful we’ll know why. Thank you.' '' 'MODERATOR: Thank you Minister thank you Secretary Blinken. Now we’ll take a couple of questions now starting with RBA.' '' 'QUESTION: Isabelle Masozera from RBA. I have a question for both officials. Secretary Blinken the State Department has designated Paul Rusesabagina as wrongfully detained. What does this mean in this case? Also we understand that you are unable to meet the victims of FLN attacks due to your tight schedule but what would you say to the victims and their families?' '' 'And also to Minister Biruta on the same issue – President Paul Kagame last night tweeted saying there are things that just won’t work here. Was this discussed this morning in the meeting and what does the government plan to do about this issue of putting pressure on releasing Rusesabagina?' '' 'SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much. We have been clear about our concerns related to Paul Rusesabagina’s trial and conviction particularly the lack of fair trial guarantees. We continue to urge the government to address our concerns about the legal protections afforded to him in his case and establish safeguards to prevent similar outcomes in the future. I had an opportunity to discuss this matter with President Kagame this morning. I’m not going to get into specifics but we’ll continue to engage on it. And I also had an opportunity just a few days ago to talk to Paul Rusesabagina’s family and we’ll continue to be in contact with them as well. Thank you.' '' 'Oh and I’m sorry the second part of your question. One of the most profound reasons that we are engaged in support of African-led mediation efforts in the eastern Congo as well as in other parts of the region is precisely because at the heart of everything is human suffering and real people individuals men women and children who are the victims of conflict the victims of violence the victim of armed groups of one kind or another. And it’s very easy to get focused on big questions of policy but what this comes down to is actual lives – real human lives. That’s what motivates me. That’s what motivates us to seek to help wherever we can resolve conflict preserve peace and give people a chance. And I think we’ve seen far too many victims of violence and conflict and that’s why we have a strong incentive to do whatever we can to end it.' '' 'I have opportunities wherever possible to meet with those who have been victimized by violence of one kind or another who have been victimized by conflict who have been victimized by a lack of opportunity that results from places and societies being in conflict. And if I don’t have an opportunity with an individual group I usually have a pretty good idea of their stories what’s happened to them. And that is the motivating factor for me every single day.' '' 'FOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA: And listen on the question about Rusesabagina as far as the Government of Rwanda is concerned Paul Rusesabagina is a Rwandan citizen. And he was arrested. He was tried and convicted along with 20 others – 20 other accomplices for serious crimes they committed against Rwandan citizens and which he committed while residing in the United States. And this was done lawfully under both Rwandan and international laws. Therefore Rwanda will continue to abide by our rules and the decisions that were made by our judiciary. And we request our partners to respect Rwanda’s sovereignty Rwanda’s laws and its institutions. That’s what I can state about your question on Rusesabagina.' '' 'MODERATOR: Yeah next question Washington Post.' '' 'QUESTION: I’m going to sit so I can read my questions so excuse me. Secretary Blinken as you mentioned in your opening remarks there have been reports of – regarding harassment and arrest of domestic dissidents by the Rwandan Government along with reports of transnational aggression including the use of spyware and alleged attacks against opponents in South Africa and Mozambique and elsewhere. Some members of the U.S. Congress are calling on the Biden administration to withhold foreign assistance and employ the Khashoggi Ban. At the same time these messages have been made before U.S. officials. Did you hear anything today that indicates there will be a change in these actions?' '' 'And going back to Paul Rusesabagina now deemed as wrongfully detained based on what I heard from the Foreign Minister it doesn’t seem like the Rwandan Government is prepared to release him. How do you believe this can be resolved? And do you believe this issue – along with the others I mentioned – will pose a threat to the two countries’ ability to work together smoothly?' '' 'And for you Mr. Minister what is your response to the allegations of domestic and transnational repression and to U.S. advocacy on these points? And what is your – how do you see the U.S. response to your government statements about Paul Rusesabagina’s alleged actions? Thank you.' '' 'SECRETARY BLINKEN: Missy thanks very much. First let me start by saying this: we recognize Rwanda’s incredibly difficult history the 1994 genocide. And we know the ongoing legacy of that history of the genocide. But criminalization of some individual’s participation in politics harassment of those who express opposition to the current government we believe underlie future peace stability and success – success which has already been extraordinary in the case of Rwanda over the last 20 plus years but which will not reach its full potential if those who express disagreements – criticism of whatever the current government happens to be are repressed in their ability to do that whether that is here in Rwanda or abroad.' '' 'And to that point as you noted we established what is called the Khashoggi Ban to make clear that any country that engages in repressive actions against those who criticize it if those persons are in the United States they face consequences for those actions.' '' 'I’ve shared all of this with President Kagame today. It’s not for me to characterize his response but these are concerns that I shared. And I did that again in the context of making clear our desire for an even stronger even more productive relationship between the United States and Rwanda building on what Rwanda has done so successfully building on what we’ve already done together. But these are issues that we care deeply about our Congress cares deeply about the American people care deeply about.' '' 'I also shared with President Kagame that in many ways our own focus and motivation on these issues goes back to our very founding. It’s maybe a little bit particular in some ways to the United States but it’s in our DNA. As you heard President Biden discuss we come – we came together as a country not around any particular group any particular race religion ethnicity. We came together around an idea a shared idea that all are created equal and that all are entitled to the same basic inalienable rights. And of course we have never made fully good on that ideal. We’re in constant search of it constant efforts to form our own more perfect union which is an acknowledgment that we’re not perfect and this is a constant ongoing effort. But we do it openly we do it transparently we deal with our challenges as I think the world can see. And so by way of explanation as well why we care so deeply about what we believe to be universal rights not simply those that pertain to Americans.' '' 'And again on the – on the matter and the case of Paul Rusesabagina all I can share with you today is that I raised this with President Kagame. We had a discussion about it. I’m not going to again characterize that. We’ll continue to engage and I’ll also follow up with the family.' '' 'FOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA: Yes. When Rwanda deals with people who commit crimes against our country and our people we abide by laws both national and international. We know some other countries have their own method to deal with those kind of people those criminals who commit crimes against their own countries. But as far as Rwanda is concerned we do it along with in respect of our laws and in respect of international laws. Any other people could qualify these as international repression or whatever but when we deal with people who commit crimes against our country against our people we abide by the laws both national and international with total (inaudible).' '' 'MODERATOR: Our next question New Times.' '' 'QUESTION: Thank you very much. My name is Edwin Musoni from The New Times. I’ll ask the minister and the Secretary of State. Minister a (inaudible) UN group of experts report indicated that the DRC army was supplying arms to FDLR and it’s also – it also indicated that the FDLR commander under that arrangement ordered the shelling of Rwandan territory in May.' '' 'Now this happens at a time when Rwanda is under pressure that it is allegedly supporting M23. What is your take on that and how can Rwandans be assured of their security?' '' 'Mr. Secretary now given – given the fact that FDLR gets support from the Congolese army how does the U.S. expect Rwanda to protect its borders against any attacks that happen like what happened in May? And also at the same time you cannot talk about FDLR without talking about the genocide. They are responsible for the genocide. Today the United States remains the only country in the world that has deliberately refused to adopt the official definition of the genocide the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. Now what’s the logic behind this deliberate stubbornness of the U.S. not adopting the genocide? Yet as you said you stand by Rwanda. Thank you.' '' 'FOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA: Rwanda is not the cause of longstanding instability in eastern DRC where we have over 130 armed groups including the M23. And the presence of the FDLR in the close collaboration with the army of the DRC has always been the most significant cause of insecurity. And this enables the FDLR to conduct terrorist operations on Rwandan territory something the Government of Rwanda cannot accept. In Rwanda we always reserve the right to take necessary measures to protect its territorial integrity its sovereignty and to ensure the security of its people. As we’ve said Rwanda remains committed to the processes mandated by the African Union and the other regional organization which we hope the United States will continue to support for all of us to bring lasting peace to eastern DRC and to the entire region. Thank you.' '' 'SECRETARY BLINKEN: There are very credible reports of support for armed groups by all sides including the FDLR by Congolese forces and M23 by Rwandans. And our position is clear. Whoever it’s by whoever it’s to – that support needs to cease for any – any armed group.' '' 'When it comes to the FDLR it has sought to conduct attacks on Rwanda and it’s supported hateful ideologies. And we’ve seen support as I said – we’ve seen reports of cooperation between Congolese forces and the FDLR. I raised this directly with the president in the Congo and we are pressing again for that support to cease just as we’re pressing for any support to M23 to cease.' '' 'These groups need to end the violence demobilize and pursue talks with the government. And as I noted both leaders – here in Rwanda and in the Congo – made clear to me that they’re prepared to engage in talks with the various armed factions as necessary in order to pursue their demobilization in the context of the process led by President Kenyatta and others the Nairobi process. We’ll continue to support that.' '' 'And when it comes to recognition of the genocide and the horrors committed we’ve been very clear about that. I’ll have an opportunity to visit the memorial in just a few hours and to continuously take note to take account of the almost unfathomable suffering of so many people that remains present in people’s lives. And we’ll continue to work at the United Nations for every appropriate recognition of history even as we do everything possible every single day to make sure that that history is never repeated. Thank you.' '' 'MODERATOR: Final question from (inaudible).' '' 'QUESTION: Hi. Following up on that same issue Mr. Secretary you mentioned your conversations with both the president of Rwanda and of the Democratic Republic of Congo. And in Congo you heard many complaints about the violence in eastern Congo and the support of Rwanda supposedly for some of the armed groups to the extent that they demanded sanctions be imposed against Rwanda. And yet here you probably heard a certain amount of popular support for the M deux trois group. So how do you reconcile those two very disparate positions in your quest for negotiations as you described? Did you specifically ask President Kagame to end the support for M23? And then finally do you now put the M23 and the FDLR on the same ground? It seems like they’re almost making a – an equivalency between the two. So I’m interested about that.' '' 'And then Mr. Minister the U.S. Government is asking you to end support for M23. How do you respond to that?' '' 'SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. So it’s a matter of principle that applies equally. This is not a question of weighing one group against another. There’s a basic principle that there should not be support coming from governments or coming from their entities like their armed forces for arming groups like – non-state groups like M23 or like FDLR. And that’s a basic principle because to the extent that that happens that’s likely to perpetuate conflict and violence not end it. It doesn’t suggest one way or another equivalence between groups or some valuation but the basic principle is very important and it’s very important here. And yes I specifically raised that with President Kagame just as I raised it with President Tshisekedi in the DRC.' '' 'We also raised another principle which is the territorial integrity of states and the need to protect that. And we also raised another principle which is that leaders have a responsibility to speak out against hate speech – something that we’ve seen unfortunately increasingly in recent months with regard to the Congo and in particular directed at certain communities including Rwandaphones and directed at the UN and its mission there.' '' 'So this is something that I raised in both – both meetings with both leaders. And the question of course is now turning principle into practice and that’s what we talked about. And the best way to do that in our judgment is to pursue the African-led mediation efforts through the Nairobi process. President Kenyatta has now been designated by the East African Community to carry on that mission even when he is no longer in office as president of Kenya. President Lourenço from Angola is also very engaged. And what we heard from both presidents is their appreciation for our own efforts the United States efforts to support that African-led mediation effort. We’ll continue to do that just as we’ve been doing in the months leading up to this visit.' '' 'FOREIGN MINISTER BIRUTA: Whatever Government of Rwanda could do in DRC or in our region would be about protecting our people and protecting the territorial integrity of our country and its sovereignty. It is not about supporting M23. And if we want a lasting solution for the problems in eastern DRC in our region we just need to deal with the root causes of the problem which is the presence and the preservation of the FDLR the FDLR in eastern DRC and their cooperation with FRDC. Let me remind you that they have together jointly they have shelled the Rwandan territory three times – on 18th March on 27 May on – and on 10th June. And we have always warned the Government of DRC – we ask them to stop those attacks. And if we need to get a lasting solution we should go to the root causes of the problems which is the genocide they acknowledge being spread in our region from – the genocide which took place here in 1994 – and the preservation of the FDLR which is a genocidal force.' '' 'And there are mechanism in place the original mechanism which were agreed on by the African Union by the East African Community by the ICJR and we just need to go to those mechanism (inaudible) us with them and you permit them. And we find solutions to the existing political issues in DRC and hopefully we achieve peace for all of us. Eastern DRC – DRC needs peace but we also need peace for us to develop our countries. Thank you.' '' 'MODERATOR: Thank you very much Secretary Blinken. Thank you Minister. Thank you much – thank you very much everybody.

'' '' '' '' '' 'advertisements' '' 'The accident occurred at Migaa about 10 kilometers from the Salgaa black spot. It occurred at 3 am when most passengers were asleep.Police said the accident may have occurred due to the bus break failure before it collided head –on with the truck that was headed to Eldoret from Nakuru.The bus belonging to Matunda Sacco mainly operates from Kitale Busia Kakamega and other western Kenya destinations to Nairobi.It was ferrying passengers from Busia to Nairobi when the accident occurred while the truck was heading to Eldoret from Nakuru according to police.Police say Sunday’s accident is the worst on that killer highway since the beginning of this month with the death toll now over 100 on that stretch alone.The East African country is ranked among countries with the worst road safety records globally based on a 2015 World Health Organisation (WHO) report titled the Global Status on Road Safety.The report shows that Kenya Tanzania and Rwanda with respectively 29.1 32.9 and 32.1 deaths per 100000 people are among the worst 10 performers on road fatalities in the continent. It is among the worst 20 in the world with Uganda placed better 27.4.While available statistics show that up to 3000 people die annually from road accidents in Kenya this year’s toll is likely to be even higher due to the increased number of accidents recorded since June.WHO differs with the country’s official statistics and instead places the annual death toll at an average of 12000 with many accidents blamed on faulty vehicles and minimal or total lack of enforcement by authorities coupled with bribery.The report shows that no African country except South Africa meets any of the UN’s seven main vehicle safety standards.Police Headquarters is yet to release the final accidents toll for 2017 which is expected at the beginning of the New Year.By December 15 the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) revealed that 150 lives had been lost for the two weeks a number that has stretched further.Other notable accidents this year is the one that claimed the life of Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru on the Nyeri-Karatina road on November 6.In December last year more than 40 people died when an out of control fuel tanker ploughed into vehicles and then exploded in Naivasha.'

"['1501 - 1600 Tutsi are dominant in the area which now comprises modern Rwanda.' '' '1890 Germans colonize Rwanda.' '' '1910 The northern and western boundaries of Rwanda are agreed upon by colonial powers and remain essentially unchanged until the present.' '' '1916 Belgian forces easily displace the German administration in Rwanda (then known as Ruanda-Urundi an area which included Burundi).' '' '1923 The League of Nations formally mandates Rwanda to Belgium (Belgian rule lasts until independence in 1962).' '' '1926 Belgians decide that the population of Rwanda should be classified as either Tutsi or Hutu. Unlike in previous times when the Hutu-Tutsi distinction was fluid (prosperous peasants could become Tutsis while Tutsis who fell on hard economic times could suffer reduced social status and become Hutus) this Belgian administrative measure now strictly designates those who own more than ten cows as Tutsi and all others as Hutu with no possibility of movement between the two groups. Imposing a Belgian practice all citizens are issued national identification cards which include an entry for tribe. Thus the complicated hierarchy of pre-colonial times is simplified with more power concentrated at the top and fewer benefits and prerogatives accruing to those at the bottom. In addition Europeans want a uniform territorial system and therefore eliminate the pockets of autonomy which had existed in pre-colonial Rwanda. Some of these autonomous regions are in fact Hutu-controlled further reducing the status of that group and enhancing Tutsi supremacy under European tutelage.' '' '1946 Ruanda-Urundi became a UN trust territory under the administration of Belgium. The Belgians begin developing institutions of self-government among the people.' '' '1951 - 1960 Hutu resistance to the Tutsi monarchy increases as does the movement for independence from Belgium among both Hutus and Tutsis.' '' '1959 The Hutu-Tutsi divide widens as ethnic politics intensify. The Parmehutu (Party for the Emancipation of the Hutu People) is pitted against the monarchist and Tutsi-led UNAR (National Rwandese Union). Belgium suddenly abandons its traditional clients and dispatches paratroopers to extirpate the Tutsi power structure. Clashes between Hutus and Tutsis commence in the north and quickly spread throughout Rwanda. An estimated 10000 Tutsis are killed with perhaps 200000 more fleeing the country.' '' 'Jan 1 - Oct 31 1961 Hutu-led political forces proclaim a Republic and abolish the Tutsi monarchy. A new constitution is drafted. The first Tutsi exile guerrilla group is formed.' '' '1961 - 1970 Tutsi exiles form paramilitary units and mount incursions into Rwanda which target local Hutu officials. Tutsi exiles operate from sanctuaries in Burundi Tanzania Uganda and Zaire. The Hutu government counters Tutsi guerrillas by deploying Belgian paratroopers and by orchestrating reprisal massacres of Tutsis.' '' '1962 Thousands are killed in Hutu-Tutsi clashes provoked by incursions by Tutsi exile guerrillas [see entry above for ""1960s""].' '' 'Jul 1 1962 Rwanda gains independence from Belgium. On the same day Rwanda becomes a founding member of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).' '' '1963 Tutsi exile guerrillas invade Rwandan territory in three waves on November 25 December 20 and December 27. In a pattern that is becoming typical [see entry above for ""1960s""] the Hutu government permits and encourages vengeance killings against Tutsi civilians [see entry below for ""1964"" for numbers of Tutsis killed and exiled].' '' '1964 Rampaging Hutus in response to Tutsi rebel incursions [see entry above for ""1963""] kill 5000 to 14000 Tutsis and drive another 200000 (out of a total of 600000 Tutsis in the country) into exile in Burundi Tanzania Uganda and Zaire.' '' '1966 Reports of Tutsi-Hutu clashes with 200 dead.' '' '1972 - 1973 Violence breaks out in southern Burundi as local Hutus attack local Tutsis followed by widespread massacres of Hutus by Tutsi army units and supporting elements throughout the country (an estimated 80000 Hutus are killed). Apparently in response to the unrest in Burundi the Hutu-dominated regime in Rwanda begins a program of expelling Tutsis from positions in government education and business. In addition counter-massacres of Tutsis occur in Rwanda resulting in about 500 deaths.' '' 'Jul 1973 A bloodless military coup is led by Major General Juvenal Habyarimana (a Hutu) who proclaims himself President. Crowds of Hutus (possibly orchestrated by the military) attack Tutsis. Portions of the 1962 constitution are suspended the legislature is dissolved and a more centralized administration is created. A comprehensive program of expelling Tutsis from schools government and business is reportedly undertaken.' '' '1974 Bujumbura Conference in which Zaire Burundi and Rwanda agree to coordinate defense and economy.' '' ""Jul 1975 President Habyarimana's National Revolutionary (changed to Republican in April 1991) Movement for Development and Democracy (MRND) is formed and declared the only legal political party (its chief task is proclaimed to be the eradication communal conflict)."" '' '1976 Economic Community of the Great Lakes (CEPGL) is formed between Rwanda Zaire and Burundi.' '' '1979 The Rwandan Patriotic Front is founded by Tutsi exiles resident in Uganda then calling themselves the Rwandese Alliance for National Unity. Harkening back to Rwanda\'s militia tradition RPF fighters also refer to themselves as the ""Inkotanyi"" or the ""the indefatigable ones."" Close ties are forged between Ugandan rebel leader Yoweri Museveni\'s National Resistance Army (NRA) and Uganda\'s Tutsi exiles. Thus when Museveni is later installed as Ugandan President political and military debts are owed to the Tutsi exiles.' '' ""1985 From this point forward Rwanda's neighbors (Burundi Uganda Tanzania and Zaire) repeatedly try to negotiate a program of systematic Tutsi repatriation but Rwanda consistently stalls claiming with some justification that there is no land or jobs for returnees (of course Rwanda's neighbors face these same limitations)."" '' '1988 As a result of disorganized rural violence by politically and socially discontented Hutus against local Tutsi officials notables and civilians in the north of Burundi the Tutsi-dominated army conducts unpremeditated massacres of Hutus. Hutu deaths are estimated to be between 5000 and 20000 or as high as 50000. An estimated 50000 Hutus also flee to Rwanda. Almost all of this wave of refugees returned home by the end of the year.' '' 'Oct 1 1990 From this point forward the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invades Rwanda from its bases in Uganda. In response the Rwandan security service distributes arms to local civilian officials. Eventually the army is increased in size to as many as 50000 effectives. RPF forces are almost exclusively made up of Tutsi fighters with a few Hutus in showcase ""political"" positions. However in a statement to the press the RPF denies that it is waging an ethnic war against the government but instead describes their goals as merely political in nature. Habyarimana\'s National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND) is divided between a hardline faction which opposes accommodation with the Tutsi rebels and a smaller conciliatory faction. There are reports that the government has arrested Tutsi businessmen teachers and priests as collaborators with the rebels. It is particularly significant that the government labels resident Tutsis with no connection to the RPF as rebel ""accomplices."" In fact many Tutsis initially support the government against the RPF but the regime decisively rebuffs them. Habyarimana admits that elite Zairian troops are helping to neutralize the RPF offensive. Habyarimana skillfully draws France directly into the conflict by staging a mock RPF ""attack"" on the capital thus deceiving foreign journalists and diplomats into believing that the rebels are on the verge of overthrowing his government. France as well as Belgium quickly dispatches contingents to bolster the internal security of Rwanda. Anti-Tutsi French political and military officials refer to the RPF as the ""Khmers Rouges"" of Africa. Belgium cuts off military aid to Rwanda after RPF offensive but it still furnishes the government with non-lethal aid.' '' 'Nov 1990 The RPF invasion is repulsed by government forces. President Habyarimana announces that he will allow multi-party politics commencing in 1991. Perhaps more importantly for settling the Hutu-Tutsi issue he also declares that the practice of specifying ethnicity on the national identification card will cease although this measure is never implemented. The World Bank loans Rwanda 80 million dollars to help solve chronic economic problems and calm heated political conditions brought on by the RPF invasion six weeks earlier.' '' '1991 The US Department of State Human Rights Report for 1991 notes that up to 200 Tutsi civilians are killed in random attacks carried out by Rwandan army units and Hutu civilians. These killings are perpetrated in the northern provinces of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri the two districts most directly threatened by RPF rebels.' '' '1991 - 1992 The RPF conducts repeated small-scale incursions into Rwanda.' '' 'Mar 1991 France gives Rwanda 13.6 million dollars worth of grant aid for the purchase of essential imports.' '' 'Jun 1991 Habyarimana signs a new Constitution which provides for multi-party politics the creation of a prime ministership a limited Presidential term (a candidate could seek a maximum of two terms of five years each) and separate executive judicial and legislative branches of government.' '' 'Jul 1 1991 From this point forward a new Political Parties Law goes into effect. It bans parties based on ethnicity or religious affiliation. Shortly thereafter five new political parties are legally registered and by the beginning of 1992 this figure rises to twelve. Although large street rallies are held demanding political changes there is no indication that the non-RPF opposition to Habyarimana is militant (for example they do not acquire guns or train for insurgency).' '' 'Aug 1991 The Justice Minister announces that an initiative is underway to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda. The release of 5500 people arrested following the RPF invasion of 1990 is announced.' '' 'Sep 1991 Belgium grants Rwanda 5.6 million dollars to support a structural adjustment program. Among other purposes the funds are to be used to train Rwandan journalists in Belgium as the first step in establishing a television network based in Kigali. At this time Belgium also announces that it will furnish Rwanda with additional food aid.' '' '1992 Habyarimana makes a series of visits to Mobutu of Zaire and Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo for advice on how to maintain his power. On their advice Habyarimana maneuvers to split two key opposition parties (one of which was composed of both Hutus and Tutsis) thus polarizing the political situation and promoting tribalism.' '' 'Jan 5 1992 Zaire Rwanda and Burundi agree to form a joint security commission to monitor their common frontiers.'

Locals said the attackers were Interahamwe. The genocide trials continued in Arusha and throughout Rwanda. In Rwanda at least 22 death sentences have been delivered since the opening of the trials.' '' 'Mar 5 1997 The FAO (U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization) said in a report issued in Nairobi that fighting in eastern Zaire and an influx of refugees to Rwanda in late 1996 had created severe food deficits. Deaths from malnutrition and disease were already being reported. Continuing political and social uncertainty and an economic embargo imposed by neighboring states have seriously undermined food production in Burundi.' '' 'Mar 17 1997 The U.N. human rights mission in Kigali has said it is ""concerned by the increase in killings and attacks against genocide survivors and persons associated with them."" RPA spokesman Major Emmanuel Ndahiro attributed the increase in attacks to the lack of screening for hard core militias in the masses returning from refugee camps in Zaire and Tanzania. Many former FAR (Rwandan Armed Forces) members have resettled in villages where they reportedly had hid arms before fleeing to Zaire.' '' 'Mar 25 1997 Roberto Garreton a U.N. human rights investigator has left for Zaire to look into reports of alleged massacres by mainly Tutsi rebels in the east. He will report his finding to the U.N. Human Rights Commission which is meeting in Geneva until April 18. More than 300000 Rwandan refugees remain unaccounted for in eastern Zaire. Refugees say they are being forced home from Zaire by Tutsi rebels and Rwandan Hutu militiamen far behind the line of rebel advance in Zaire.' '' ""May 1997 Maurice Sebahunde sub-prefect of Ngororero was shot in an ambush. He was a former intelligence agent under the Hutu regime of Juvenal Habyarimana. He was accused of plotting a coup in the 1980s and placed under arrest. He was freed by RPF soldiers. Attacks and assassinations have increased in recent months in the northwest because of the infiltration of Hutu extremists from Goma Zaire. The United Nations said at least 137 civilians were massacred by the army in reprisal operations in Ruhengeri in March. Ruhengeri is populated mainly by Hutus and is the scene of an insurgency by Hutu rebels. Witnesses put the number of killed much higher. The military told U.N. authorities that Ruhengeri's battalion commander was responsible for the killings and that he had been arrested. During the month at least 14 defendants were found guilty of genocide and sentenced to death. Amnesty International condemned the risk of unfair trials which could lead to the execution of a large number of Rwandans accused of genocide. A Nigerian jurisprudence specialist Agwu Uwike Okali was named new registrar of the Arusha tribunal."" '' ""May 6 1997 The U.N. Children's Fund reported a rise in the number of Rwandan Hutu refugee children with bullet and machete wounds in eastern Zaire. Spokeswoman Marie Heuze accused the rebels of blocking relief work so as to put the blame for the chaos of the region on the U.N. system. She said there were few supplies available to dress the wounds."" '' ""May 13 1997 The Rwandan government and the UNHCR (U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees) are trying to speed up repatriation of 30000 refugees from Zaire. Humanitarian agencies have estimated that 50000 Rwandans are stranded in the Zairean town of Mbandaka and 17500 are trying to cross into Angola. They are being driven from refugee camps by ex-FAR and Interahamwe members. The U.N. Security Council has expressed its concern about Rwanda's deteriorating prison conditions and poor judicial system and has called on the government to improve them. They also expressed concern over the deterioration of the overall security situation in Rwanda and condemned attacks on the civilian population."" '' 'May 18 1997 Rwanda and Kenya recognized the government of Laurent Kabila in Zaire.' '' 'Jun 3 1997 The U.N. human rights office in Kigali said state agents were blamed for 162 killings over a six week period until mid-May. One hundred fifty two were slain by soldiers in the northwestern border region of Ruhengeri. One hundred eighty two others were killed in ethnically motivated violence in the same period of which at least 51 were blamed on Hutu rebels. The human rights office had no information on abuses committed against refugees returned from Zaire and Tanzania because most of them have returned to border regions which are off-limits to relief workers because of the guerrilla war being waged by Hutu rebels against the Tutsi-dominated army. Women reportedly now make up 70% of the Rwandan population.' '' ""Jul 18 1997 Kenyan authorities arrested seven people including former Rwandan Prime Minister Jean Kambanda suspected of involvement in the 1994 genocide. They are being held in Arusha Tanzania. Kambanda rose to power when his predecessor Agathe Uwilingiyamana and a dozen Belgian U.N. troops protecting her were slaughtered following the death of President Habyarimana. The others arrested are Pauline Nyramasuhuko interim Family Welfare Minister; Nyramasuhuko's son; Col. Gratien Kabiligi; Commander Aloys Ntabakuze; Sylvain Nsabrimana prefect of Butane the site of many Tutsi massacres; and Hassan Ngeze a prominent media figure accused of distributing materials inciting violence against Tutsis.

So far the tribunal has tried only four suspects and no decisions have been handed down.""

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said Tanzania expelled about 600 refugees as well as Tanzania nationals of Rwandan origin over the past two weeks. Thirty-six thousand refugees mostly Tutsis remained in Ngara district despite the massive repatriation scheme. Most do not live in refugee camps.' '' ""Nov 13 1997 Rwanda's economy has been shattered by years of conflict but the government has vowed to repay all foreign debts incurred by previous regimes.
