At least two people died and 18 were injured when a grenade exploded last evening in Marembo Village, Nyabisindu Cell in Remera, Gasabo District.

The explosion happened at about 6:40 p.m.

The injured were immediately rushed to various hospitals in Kigali, including Kibagabaga, Kanombe Military Hospital, Kacyiru Police Hospital, and the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK).

Police Spokesperson, Supt Theos Badege, said that more details will emerge as investigations continue.

“We have sealed off the area and are carrying out investigations to know if it was thrown by someone or if it had been planted earlier on. It is just a matter of time before we know the exact circumstances,” Badege said.

In 2010, a series of grenade attacks hit the country. As many as 30 people were arrested in connection with the terror activities, with some of them pleading guilty to terrorism related charges.
