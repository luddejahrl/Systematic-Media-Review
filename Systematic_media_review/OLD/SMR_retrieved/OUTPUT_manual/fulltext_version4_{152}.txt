In Rwanda, at least 65 people were killed in flooding and landslides after overnight heavy rains. Nearly 100 homes were washed away.

The Ministry of emergency management said, the East African nation has seen dozens of deaths caused by torrential rains in recent weeks but this downpour was the worst in months.


The flooding and mudslides swept away bridges and left some roads inaccessible.
