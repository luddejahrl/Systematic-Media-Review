May 8 (UPI) -- Landslides killed at least 18 people in Rwanda over the weekend, pushing the death toll from heavy rains in the country since January over 200.

The heavy rains caused landslides that also injured 7 others Sunday. According to Rwanda's Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees, 29 homes were destroyed.

Fifteen people were killed in two provinces while three others were swept away early Sunday elsewhere in the country.

"The [past] four months have been far worse than last year and other years. This is terrifying," Philippe Habinshuti, director of response and recovery unit at the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs, said.

Nearly 10,000 homes, 58 roads and seven churches were also destroyed since the beginning of the year, the ministry said.

The World Meteorological Organization attributed "above-average seasonal rainfall" to the loss of life and floods in East Africa.
