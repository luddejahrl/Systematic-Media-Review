KIGALI, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Landslides triggered by heavy downpour on Sunday left 13 people dead and two others injured in different parts of Rwanda, the Ministry of Emergency Management said Monday, warning that the death toll could rise.

Majority of those killed were from the capital Kigali's Kicukiro, Gasabo, and Nyarugenge districts, Olivier Kayumba, the Permanent Secretary in Rwanda's Ministry of Emergency Management told reporters in a news briefing.

In one of the incidents, a landslide destroyed a house in Kanombe sector, Kicukiro district, killing three family members, a mother and two children, he said.
