KIGALI, 18 April 2012 (IRIN) - Hundreds of people have been displaced and several killed by flash floods in the mountainous district of Musanze in northern Rwanda, and in the western districts of Nyabihu and Rubavu, say officials.

"The region has received non-stop rain for the whole past week and more floodwater should be expected in the coming days as well," a senior researcher with Rwanda Meteorological Services, told IRIN.

At least 876 hectares of land has been inundated, turning floodplains into raging rivers, which damaged roads, bridges, schools and clinics, said the Ministry for Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs.

Food and non-food assistance is being provided to the affected residents, some of whom are seeking refuge in makeshift camps, according to Rwanda Red Cross Northern Province representative Muhayimana Marie Solange.

The government is helping to airlift supplies to those cut off by the floods. An assessment of flood damage is yet to be carried out.
