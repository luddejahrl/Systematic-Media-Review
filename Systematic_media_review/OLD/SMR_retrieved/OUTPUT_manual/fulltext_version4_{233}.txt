KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Rwanda police say two people were killed and two others seriously wounded following a grenade attack in the capital.

Rwandan police said that 30 other people received minor injuries after the grenade went off on Friday evening in Gitega Sector of Kigali’s Nyarugenge District.

Police say one person has been arrested in connection to the blast and urged residents to remain calm as investigations continue.

Rwanda had been hit by series of grenade attacks surrounding the 2010 elections. President Paul Kagame won that election by a landslide, though the vote was criticized for banning opposition parties.
