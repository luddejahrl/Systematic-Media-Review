NYABIHU - At least four people have been confirmed dead and 17 seriously injured following heavy rains that started on Friday night in Rubavu and Nyabihu districts.

According to Rubavu Sector Executive Secretary, three children from one family drowned when floods destroyed part of their house. Another person died in Rugerero Sector.

Western province Executive Secretary, Paul Jabo, told Sunday Times that government was bringing in tents to evacuate residents on Rubavu hill

Nyundo seminary was also affected by the floods and students expressed fear that they are likely to persist.

The head of the seminary, Rev. Fr. Vincent Harorimana, also expressed worry wondering what the school would do should there be more heavy rainy and floods.

“We are doing what we can but it is becoming increasingly difficult to cope,” said Harorimana

Nyundo Health Centre was also affected when Sebeya River overflowed forcing patients to flee the hospital.
Harorimana said that the army intervened to help in rescue efforts at the seminary and health centre.

A meeting to decide the fate of residents of Rubavu hill was held at the district headquarters and chaired by the Minister of Forestry and Mines, Christophe Bazivamo.
