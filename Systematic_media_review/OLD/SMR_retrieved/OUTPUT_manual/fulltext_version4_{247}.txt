Two people died on Wednesday in Rwamagana district after a cliff of a closed granite mining site in Bicumbi Cell, Mwulire sector, caved in.Police said the victims were mining illegally when a shaft collapsed, killing the miners instantly. The victimsâ€™ bodies were taken to Rwamagana Hospital for post-mortem.  The District Police Commander, Richard Rubagumya, said only mining sites in Musha sector are operational. Mining is an economic activity in the district. Some of the minerals in the district are tin and wolfram.   Rubagumya said the collapse of the shaft was caused by torrential rain in the area, which weakened the soils. He cautioned miners in the area to be watchful and desist from operating in risky and closed mining sites.Rubagumya advised the residents to form cooperatives that are recognised so they can get insurance and payment of indemnity.
