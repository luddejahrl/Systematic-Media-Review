Tragedy yesterday morning struck Bugarama cell, Jenda sector in Nyabihu District, when a mudslide claimed the lives of three teenagers who were excavating for soil to build bricks for their houses.

The victims were identified as Marie Claire Nzayikunda 17, Nyirangabo Urayeneza 19, and Pascaline Uwurukundo 19. Ernest Niyigenda, was rescued and taken to Jenda Health Centre.

The incident was reported by two other children who escaped from the scene unharmed.

The bodies were exhumed and handed over to their respective families for burial.

The Executive Secretary of Jenda Sector, Theoneste Gashugi, warned residents against extracting soil from risky sites.

“The youth come from Karago Sector, and were excavating for soil from risky sites. This is a new site. We had stopped people from doing so in such unprotected areas; we feel sorry for what happened here,’’ Gashugi said.


Residents within the volcanic areas, gather clay to mould bricks in particular sites, which makes it risky since they have to dig deep to get to the right soil.
