Two children died when torrential rains pounded Musheri Sector in Nyagatare District over the weekend.

Four other people sustained injuries while properties, including houses and plantations, were destroyed.

Several families were also left homeless.

“We suffered huge losses…It was a terrible experience, we thought it was the same biblical flood that swept the world during Noah's days,” Dina Nibagwire, one of the affected residents, told The New Times. 

According to local authorities, 67 houses and an estimated 30 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed.
