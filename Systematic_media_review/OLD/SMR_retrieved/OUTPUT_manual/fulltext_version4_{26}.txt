Three Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF) soldiers died and 21 others were injured when a military truck they were travelling in overturned yesterday.

The accident occurred in Kicukiro District, a few metres from the trading centre.

The truck was transporting soldiers from Nyanza on the Kigali-Nyamata road to drop them off to their various stations for duty, according to Lt Col René Ngendahimana, the acting military and defence spokesperson.

“Six soldiers suffered serious injuries, the injured have been admitted to Rwanda Military Hospital, Kanombe, for treatment,” said Ngendahimana.

The identities of the deceased soldiers were not released by press time. As well, the cause of the accident was yet to be established pending Police investigation.

But preliminary reports pointed to brake failure, Ngendahimana said.

In June, seven people died in another accident on Nyamata–Kigali road around Kicukiro trading centre when a truck that was transporting sand experienced brake failure. It hit over 13 other vehicles in the busy area.

Residents yesterday called on officials to look for alternative routes for heavy trucks to minimise accidents in the area.

“The road is dangerous, it was a miracle that we saw survivors in this latest accident as it seemed to be more deadly. I think heavy trucks should get alternative routes or be allowed access on the road during off-peak hours only,” said Theoneste Ndikubwami, a resident.
