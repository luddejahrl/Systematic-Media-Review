Two people died and 10 others suffered severe injuries in an accident on Kigali-Gicumbi highway on Monday, Police confirmed.

The accident occurred at around 8:30pm in Mutete Sector, Gicumbi District, at a spot called ‘Rwafandi’.

One person died on the spot while another died from Byumba Hospital where he had been taken for treatment.

The deceased were identified as Betty Kayitesi and Isidore Habumugisha.

The accident involved a coaster belonging to Stella transport agency and a truck, according to Jean Marie Vianney Ndushabandi, the Traffic and Road Safety spokesperson.

Ndushabandi said preliminary investigations show that the accident was caused by the truck driver, who he said was speeding.

“The driver lost control of the truck and it collided head-0n with the coaster from the opposite direction. The injured are being treated from the same hospital,” said Ndushabandi.

He urged motorists to be cautious on the road, adding that some roads such as the Gicumbi-Kigali highway have many sharp bends.

“Motorists wishing to overtake should also follow traffic rules and do so through the right side,” Ndushabandi added.

“I was near the road and heard the vehicles hooting from both sides shortly before we heard a loud bang and people screaming. We rushed to the scene and tried to rescue some of the passengers but some were in bad shape,” a witness, only identified as Ayinkamiye, said.

Medics at Byumba Hospital said some of those admitted at the health facility were under intensive care, while others were out of danger after being treated of minor injuries.
