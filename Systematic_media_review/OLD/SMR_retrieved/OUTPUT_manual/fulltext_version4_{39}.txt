A FOUR-YEAR-old child died on spot after he was knocked by a speeding coaster on the Huye-Kigali highway on Friday, police have said.

The toddler, identified as Sylvestre Niyonsenga, was knocked as he naively crossed the road and met with a passenger bus. 

And as the driver of the coaster bus, belonging to Omega Car Company, which was from the south-western district of Rusizi to Kigali, tried to avoid hitting the child, the bus veered off the road, the Southern Region Police Spokesperson Chief Superintendent, Hubert Gashagaza, told The New Times.

As a result, 13 passengers in the coaster bus sustained injuries, and were rushed at the Huye-based University Teaching Hospital of Butare (CHUB).

However, by press time, the majority of them had been discharged and only four remained under intensive medical care.

The accident occurred at around 11am in Rusatira Sector, according to Police.

CSP Gashagaza said preliminary investigations have shown that the accident could have been caused by speeding, but also attributed it to careless parents who left the toddler to cross the road by himself.

“It is a tragedy, parents should always keep an eye on their children,” he added.

He also called upon drivers to avoid speeding which he said is one of the major causes of road accidents in the country.

The accident comes barely five days after another accident in the same sector left a bride, groom and two other individuals seriously injured. 

The couple and their guests were driving from an introduction and dowry giving ceremony in Huye to Nyanza District, where they were due to exchange their marriage vows. They are still recovering in hospital.

About two weeks ago, another fatal  accident occurred on the Kigali-Kagitumba highway leaving 15 people dead and 20 others in critical condition. It was also blamed on speeding.

At least 1324 road accidents were reported in the first half of 2014, killing 97 people, according to Police figures.
