Fifty passengers on Wednesday cheated death when the bus they were travelling in lost one of its front wheels and veered off the road along the Huye-Kigali highway.

The passengers, travelling in Horizon bus coach (registration number UAM 019L) en route from Bukavu, DR Congo via Kigali to Kampala, comprised mainly Congolese and Ugandan nationals.

The accident took place at a corner located in Gatagara, Mukingo Sector of Nyanza District, when the bus lost a wheel, swerved off the road and ultimately overturned.

15 of the passengers, all with minor injuries, were immediately rushed to the nearby hospital. According to health officials, many of the admitted patients were discharged last night while the remaining could be released anytime.

The Southern Province Police Spokesperson Chief Superintendent Hubert Gashagaza told The New Times that ensuring proper mechanical condition of vehicles could help avoid such traffic accidents.
