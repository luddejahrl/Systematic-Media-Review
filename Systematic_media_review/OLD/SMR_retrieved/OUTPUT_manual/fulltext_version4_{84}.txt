KIGALI, Thursday

A grenade blast that wounded 10 people at a bus station in central Rwanda this week was a criminal attack, not an accident, police spokesman Theos Badege said Thursday.

Badege "condemned the criminal act as cowardly and aimed at interrupting public tranquility," a statement said.

On Tuesday evening when the blast went off in Muhanga district, police had been unable to say whether it was an accident or an attack.

A number of grenade attacks have hit Rwanda over the past few years, with most targeting markets or bus stations in the evening rush hour.

Accidental blasts also occur from time to time, usually when children stumble across unexploded devices.
