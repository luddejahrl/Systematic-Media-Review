Three people were killed, yesterday, in Nyabihu District when an oil tanker skidded off the road, smashed into a house nearby and burst into flames.

According to Police, the accident that occurred in Jenda Sector of the Western Province district took place at around 6:45am.

Superintendent Emmanuel Hitayezu, the Western Regional Police spokesperson, said two people died from the crashed house, while another died during attempts to rescue him.

The deceased have been identified as Kanyarugano Seyeze, 82, and his spouse Perouth Nyangufi, 72.

The third victim was identified as Gentille Toyota, 37, a neighbour to the elderly couple.

Aline Mwiza sustained serious injuries in the accident.

Bodies of the deceased where taken to Bigogwe Health Centre for postmortem exam, while the injured were undergoing treatment at the same health facility.

Supt. Hitayezu said preliminary investigations show that the driver of the tanker was speeding.

“The driver was speeding and failed to control the truck and due to the high speed the second wagon of the tanker detached from it and rammed into the house before catching fire. It was unfortunate that we were not able to rescue anyone in the house,” he said.

Police firefighters put out the ensuing inferno and ensured that it did not spread to other homes along the route.The driver of the oil tanker and two other passengers, reportedly of Congolese nationality, fled the scene following the accident.

It is believed that they fled back to DR Congo in another truck.

Relatives of the deceased have called for those responsible to be brought to justice.

“We unfortunately arrived on the scene too late to rescue them. The driver should be arrested and face justice. Others would learn from that,” said Dieudonné Kajiwabo, a nephew to one of the victims.

Hitayezu urged motorists to always read signposts along the roads, avoid speeding and ensure their vehicles are in good mechanical condition in order to prevent avoidable accidents.
