A grenade attack on the streets of Kigali, the capital of Rwanda on Wednesday night injured at least seven, according to police, just hours after President Paul Kagame was declared winner of the top job in the country. Bystanders saw two children wounded and one woman who lost an eye, adding that the number of injured was at least 20.

Police say the grendade was thrown near Kigali's main bus station.

The election was highly criticised for lack of real opposition, as the three candidates against Kagame had given their votes to the president in the last election.

The Commonweath election observers said that the campaign was marked by "a lack of critical opposition votes."

The lead-up to the vote was marked by arrests and killings as members of opposition parties, which were not allowed to register, were not involved in the actual elections.
