Two people were killed and 16 injured in the explosion of a grenade on Tuesday evening in the Rwandan capital Kigali, official sources said on Wednesday.

The explosion took place around 7 p.m. in the Remera sector, located in the Gasabo district, Rwandan police spokesman Theos Badege told AFP. At the time of the explosion, eighteen people were injured, he said, adding that two of them had succumbed to their injuries. An investigation has been opened but no suspects have yet been arrested, added Mr. Badege. Authorities have in the past blamed similar attacks on Hutu rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and former officials in exile. Rwanda has indeed been the scene of several grenade attacks in recent years. The last one, in July 2011 in the south-west of the country, caused 21 minor injuries. Another grenade attack caused the death of two people in the capital in January 2011. In 2010, the year of the presidential election, five people lost their lives in attacks of the same nature in Kigali, hitherto considered a of the safest capitals in Africa.
