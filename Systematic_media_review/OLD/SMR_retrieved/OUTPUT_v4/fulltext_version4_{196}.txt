"We do not know for the moment if it is an accidental explosion or an attack", declared Mr. Badege, specifying that the incident had injured a dozen but none killed. The explosion took place in the early evening in the rural district of Muhanga (center), along a road and near a bus station where street vendors were offering mobile phone cards. Rwanda has been the scene of several grenade attacks in recent years, raising fears of a destabilization of the country, held in an iron fist by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF, dominated by Tutsis and President Paul Kagame). Authorities have in the past blamed the grenade attacks on Hutu rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and former officials in exile. In July 2011, in the south-west of the country, an attack of this kind caused 21 minor injuries. Another grenade attack killed two people in the capital in early January. In 2010, the year of the presidential election, five people lost their lives in similar attacks in Kigali, until then considered one of the safest capitals in Africa.
