KIGALI, Rwanda â€” Witnesses say a grenade explosion killed at least two people in a suburb of the Rwandan capital on Friday.
The blast took place at rush hour near a busy taxi rank about two kilometers from Kigali International Airport. This area is heavily guarded by the army and the police.
Authorities quickly cordoned off the area, while the injured were taken to hospital.
A Rwandan police spokesman, Theos Badege, confirmed the incident and said police were looking for the attackers.
Last year, the Rwandan capital was rocked by a series of grenade attacks, particularly in the run-up to the presidential election in August.
