Damn! why must bloody attacks precede the start of the campaign at the approach of each election in Rwanda? Last Saturday, September 14, one person was killed and eight others injured following the explosion of a grenade in a market in Kigali.

In 2010, before the presidential election, several attacks also killed a total of four people and injured around fifty. Similar attacks then took place on symbolic dates.
