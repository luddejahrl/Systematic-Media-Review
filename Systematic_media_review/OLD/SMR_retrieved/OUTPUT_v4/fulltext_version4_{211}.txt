One person was killed and eight were injured in the early evening of March 26 in Kigali when a grenade exploded near a market and the bus station. Two people were arrested. The attack has not been claimed.

The grenade was thrown in the Kimironko district between the bus station and the market, near where motorcycle taxis usually park. It is therefore a very busy place during the day and especially at the time of the attack.

Yesterday, later in the evening, the neighborhood had regained its calm. A few soldiers were posted at the corner of the almost deserted street, which was no longer cordoned off. Only a bloody puddle was visible on the floor, but no property damage.

When questioned, the server of a bar located a few meters from the scene of the attack, said that he was inside when he heard the explosion. He then ran out and saw many injured civilians lying on the ground. But he was quickly pushed back by the police.

According to the Rwandan police spokesperson, the attack left one dead and eight injured. Two people have already been arrested according to him. But he gave no indication of the possible motives for this attack.

The last grenade attacks in Kigali date back to the beginning of 2012 and left at least two people dead and several injured. They had been attributed, according to the authorities, to dissidents and Hutu FDLR rebels, based in eastern DRC.

Another series of attacks also targeted the capital in 2010 in the run-up to the presidential election. All these attacks took place in busy neighborhoods.
