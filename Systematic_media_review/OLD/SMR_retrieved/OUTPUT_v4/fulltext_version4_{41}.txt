A passenger vehicle carrying 65 people overturned in Kabarondo Sector, Kayonza District, injuring more than half of the occupants yesterday.The ill-fated bus, registration number RAC 104 B,  was one of the few that ply the Kabarondo  - Nasho route everyday.According to witnesses and survivors, the bus’ brakes failed before it overturned three times.Frederiko Habihirwe, one of the passengers on board told The New Times that the bus was overloaded with goods and people. “We were so lucky...it overturned thrice and was only stopped by small trees before it could go down the slope. We were inches away from our death...I believe no one would have survived if the bus overturned one more time down the stessp,” he said. Sometimes, such buses that ply routes in rural parts of the country carry excess passengers because of lack of traffic police, Hibihirwe said. There were about 20 passengers standing in the bus’ aisle, he added.Hospital overwhelmed Dr. Fulgence Nyikabahizi, who was attending to the injured at Rwinkwavu Hospital, said that some patients would be transported to Kigali University Central Hospital.“We must admit that we were overwhelmed by sudden admission of 55 accident victims. At least 14 had head injuries; six were in  critical condition and were transported to Kigali for further treatment. The rest will be treated from here”.Police said investigation into the real cause of the accident was still going on, but could not rule out mechanical faults.
