KIGALI - Seven people were injured when a Toyota Camry Reg: RAB 959T lost control and rammed into Omni Bus yesterday. The accident occurred near the Parliament.

Eye witnesses and police attributed the accident to reckless driving. “He was driving at a high speed. I saw the vehicle flying to another lane from where it hit a minibus,” an eye witness said.

Traffic boss, Chief Supt. Vincent Sano, confirmed the accident was caused by over speeding. He said the driver of the Toyota sustained serious injuries while the six others had minor injuries.

“Because it’s [the Toyota] a FODEY SECURITY vehicle, we assume that these are vehicles used for rescue missions, but they should not over speed and they must adhere to the speed limits to avoid accidents,” Sano said.

He warned road accidents are likely to increase during the festive season, especially on highways, particularly Kigali-Huye, Kigali-Musanze and Kigali Rwamagana roads.

Sano said Police plans to meet transporters and advise them on how to drive cautiously during this period.
“These are days with a lot of excitement when many people are in holidays,” he said.

Traffic Police records between two to four fatal accidents and six to nine minor accidents per day.
