RWAMAGANA- About 25 people were injured in three separate accidents on the Kigali-Rwamagana highway, Saturday night, Police said.

In one of the accidents, a lorry carrying over 30 people is said to have lost control after its brakes failed, causing it to roll over a hill in Kimima village in Munyaga sector, at around 9.00 p.m.

About 25 people suffered injuries while the driver, Emmanuel Gisabune, escaped unhurt and has gone on the run.

“Several people were transported (to a local hospital), but nothing life- threatening,” Police said.

“We are searching for the driver…he was carrying passengers in a lorry against traffic regulations and 30 passengers at that. The vehicle itself was in a dangerous mechanical condition, which is why, it couldn’t brake,” Police added.

One of the victims, Claude Ruberuka, admitted at Rwamagana Hospital, said he only remembers that the lorry carried many people.

“We were coming from a wedding in Rwamagana town,” he said.
In another accident, a speeding passenger’s taxi knocked down a cyclist injuring him seriously.

The accident occurred at Nyagasambu, just few kilometres from Kigali city on the same day.

The third accident in Rwamagana town involved a speeding motorcycle which had a head-on collision with a taxi.
Gabriel Muganza, a nurse Rwamagana Hospital who was treating the injured, said they were overwhelmed by the sudden surge of patients.

“We are actually treating minor injuries, but their number is big compared to the space we have in wards.” he said.
