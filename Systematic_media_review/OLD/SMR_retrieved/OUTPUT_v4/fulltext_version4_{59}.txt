At least five people sustained serious injuries when a bus they were travelling in lost control and overturned.

The accident took place, Friday morning, at Kigoma along the Kigali-Gatuna road. The bus, owned by Horizon bus services, was heading to Kigali from Kampala. Among the injured were four Congolese nationals and one Ugandan.

According to the passengers, the bus driver identified as Sulati Madania, had dozed off before the bus veered off the road.

He fled after the incident for fear of arrest.

“He was half asleep and driving at a very high speed, he failed to negotiate a corner,” said one of the passengers.

The police said the injured passengers were immediately rushed to Byumba Hospital, adding that the driver was careless as the corner he was supposed to negotiate was not very sharp.

“Gatuna highway has sharp corners and if a driver is not sober, these kinds of accidents are likely to occur,” said one of the police officers at the scene.

Meanwhile, police also arrested two suspects in connection with the theft of luggage belonging to passengers of the ill-fated bus.

According to Gicumbi police, accidents on the Gatuna road have drastically reduced due to increased vigilance by the traffic police.
