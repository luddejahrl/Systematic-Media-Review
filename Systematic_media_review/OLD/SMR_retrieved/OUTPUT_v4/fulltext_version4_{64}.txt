Four people, including three women, died on the spot while nine others sustained injuries when a passenger minibus got involved in an accident, yesterday, in the City of Kigali.

The accident happened in Nyamirambo, Nyarugenge District at about 7:15am after the minibus registration number RAB251G lost control and swerved off the road.

The nine people who sustained injuries including the driver, were taken to the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK). Three of them are said to have got minor injuries.

The omnibus was heading to Mageragere from Nyamirambo.

Supt Jean Marie Vianney Ndushabandi, the Spokesperson for Traffic and Road Safety Department of the Rwanda National Police, told The New Times that the accident was caused by speeding.

“Due to speeding the driver swerved identified as Emmanuel Hakizimana, failed to negotiate a corner and lost control,” he said.

“It is not understandable why the vehicle driving from one sector to another could speed on a tarmac road,” he said, adding that some sources said the driver was drunk.

By press time, Ndushabandi said the three people who sustained minor injuries could be discharged anytime.
