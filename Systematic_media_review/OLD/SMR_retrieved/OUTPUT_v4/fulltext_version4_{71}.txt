A terribly nasty accident involving a trailer this morning claimed a yet to be identified number of people in Kicukiro district. The trailer which was transporting sand crashed 12 vehicles and several pedestrians at around 10:30am after the driver lost control. Various news sources say the trailer first crashed motorcycles which were parked by the roadside before it rammed into Royal Bus and later collided head-on with KBS bus.

A few minutes ago Police issued a statement in a tweet saying seven people have died on the spot while 9 were injured and have been rushed to hospital.
