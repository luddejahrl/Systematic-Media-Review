Five people sustained serious injuries and eight others got minor injuries after the commuter taxi registration number RRA 041U they were travelling in last evening lost control and rammed into another vehicle before it hit a pavement at Kanogo roundabout.

According to an eye witness who was identified as Jean Jack Rubangisa the taxi was coming from the city centre heading to Remera.

“The taxi lost control after hitting another vehicle and eventually crashed into the road side pavement,” Rubangisa added.

“It was on a high speed before it rammed into the other vehicle,” said Peace Murenzi a traffic police officer who was at the scene.

The taxi driver was seriously injured with both his legs  visibly broken.

Some of the injured people were taken to CHUK hospital while others were rushed to Kanombe Military Hospital by SAMU (Service Aid Medical Agency) vans that arrived at the scene minutes after.
