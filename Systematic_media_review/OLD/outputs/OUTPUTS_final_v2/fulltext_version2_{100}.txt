An explosion killed one person and wounded five others Friday in northern Rwanda, a police spokesman said, adding that a probe had been launched to determine the nature of the explosive device.


The blast occurred on Friday evening at a bus park in the town of Musanze, around 90 kilometres (56 miles) north of the capital Kigali, Theos Badege told AFP.

"We don't know the nature of the explosive device. Investigations are under way to determine whether it was a grenade or not," added Badege, saying that the blast also damaged nearby vehicles.

Several civilians have been killed or wounded in grenade attacks in the past. In January, 10 people were injured in a central Rwanda town, days after two others were killed and 16 wounded in the capital Kigali.

Security forces have previously blamed attacks on the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Rwandan Hutu rebel group based in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as former security officials in exile.
