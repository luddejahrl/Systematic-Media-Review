Police in Rwanda say they have arrested two suspects in connection with a grenade blast that wounded at least 10 people in the southern part of the central African country.

The blast happened late Tuesday near a public transportation facility in the central Rwandan town of Muhanga.

Earlier this month, a similar grenade attack killed two people and wounded 16 in the capital, Kigali. Police have not arrested any suspects for that attack.

Rwanda has been hit by a series of grenade attacks in the past few years, which the government has blamed on rebel groups and former military officers in exile.
