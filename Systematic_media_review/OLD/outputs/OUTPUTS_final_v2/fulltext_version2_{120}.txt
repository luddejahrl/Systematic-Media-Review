A grenade attack killed two people in Kigali on Friday, Rwandan police said. Another 32 people were wounded, including two who were “seriously injured.”

“There was a grenade attack. We have two dead and two seriously injured,” police spokesman Theos Badege said, adding that a further 30 people sustained slight injuries in the attack which happened shortly before 17.00 GMT near an abattoir, commonly known as “marathon,” in the capital’s Nyabugogo district.

On Twitter, the Rwandan police said that one person has been arrested, but that the investigations continued as the scene was cordoned-off for investigators to gather more evidence.

In March, a grenade attack on the Kimironko taxi park in the capital left one person dead and eight wounded. The latest series of grenade attacks in Rwanda, which have mostly targeted busy areas of the capital shortly after nightfall, began in 2010.

The government attributed the attacks to Rwanda's former army chief of staff General Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, though he recently denied it in an interview on French radio RFI.

“There is some school of thought indicating that those grenade attacks were thrown around by the military intelligence with an intention of accusing [political opponent Victoire] Ingabire and accusing her of throwing those grenades, but when I left, they shifted it against me,” he said.

Though Rwanda’s High Court sentenced 19 people to prison terms from five years to life for their limited involvement in the series of grenade attacks, it remains unclear who or what group is behind them.
