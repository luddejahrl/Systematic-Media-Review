Kigali Basketball Club player Jean Guy Rutayisire died in a car accident yesterday in Nkoto, Kamonyi district while travelling to Huye with his teammates for a league game against University of Rwanda – Huye. Rutayisire died on the spot but three teammates including Junior Hamis Mutebi, Meshach Ryamungu and Tom suffered critical injuries and are currently admitted at King Faisal, Kibagabaga and CHUK hospitals respectively.

Mutebi, who was occupying the front seat by the window with Rutayisire in the middle, had to jump out of the car after the first collision before the Volcano coaster they were travelling in rolled downhill.

Guard Sankara Uwimana was discharged yesterday from CHUK and other team members have remained in hospital to be closely examined by medical staff.

Kigali BC president Kaliste expressed sorrow at the tragic accident. “This is a very terrible incident that has claimed Guy. He was a good person and we shall miss him. It is really absurd.”

Rutayisire formerly played for Uganda’s most successful basketball club, Falcons between 2000-2005 before joining APR from 2005-2008, winning three league titles with the army side.

Yesterday’s league games were cancelled following the tragic incident. By press time, details of the burial were yet to be confirmed by the family. Five people died in this heartbreaking accident.
