One person died on the spot and 27 others were injured when a bus they were travelling in lost control and swerved off the road.

The accident took place in Gisenyi, near Rubavu District Hospital on Sunday afternoon.

Superintendent Emmanuel Hitayezu, the Western Province Regional Police spokesperson, confirmed the incident, saying preliminary investigation revealed that the bus failed to stop due to faulty braking system.

The vehicle, registration number RAB 537 R, was heading to Rubavu from Kigali with 48 passengers onboard.

The passengers were going to attend wedding ceremonies in Rubavu town, according to Police.

The driver was driving at a high speed and when the bus experienced a flat tire it veered off the road, Police said.

The deceased was identified as Mihigo Munanira, 60.

The injured were rushed to Gisenyi Hospital, four in critical condition.

Dr Major William Kanyankore, the Gisenyi Hospital director, said about ten victims with minor injuries were treated and discharged.

â€œOnly six people who had serious injuries are being given special care at the hospital.

Eyewitnesses said the bus was speeding at the time of the accident.

The area where the accident took place is regarded as a blackspot. In another recent incident a vehicle rammed into the hospital fence before it stopped.

Hitayezu urged drivers and vehicle owners to do regular mechanical checks of their vehicles and always be cautious while on the road.

There is need to be cautious and read traffic signs along the roads as some drivers are involved in accidents in dangerous spots they are not used to, he said.
