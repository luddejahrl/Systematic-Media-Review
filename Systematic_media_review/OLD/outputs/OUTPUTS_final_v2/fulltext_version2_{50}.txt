Police says at least five people were killed in a road accident this morning after the vehicle they were traveling in overturned in Rulindo District, Northern Province.

Preliminary findings indicate that the accident was caused by break failure forcing the mini bus registration number RAA 784J to overturn several times killing three of its occupants on the spot.

Two others died on arrival at the infirmary. Ten passengers are in critical condition after they sustained serious injuries while five others escaped with minor injuries.

Sources on the scene say the bus was carrying relatives and friends going for a wedding function and that the bride and groom are believed to be among those who have died.

But Police canâ€™t confirm or deny those reports as the identities of the dead are yet to be established. The incident happened this morning between 9 and 10 am near Tumba College.
