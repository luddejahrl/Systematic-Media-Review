One person died on the spot while nine others were seriously injured in an accident that occurred Monday morning along the Musanze-Cyanika highway in Burera District.

Inspector of Police Elvis Munyaneza, the Northern Province police regional police spokesperson, confirmed the incident attributing it to lack of experience of the driver.

According to Munyaneza, at the time of the accident, the car, a passenger service omnibus, was being driven by the conductor who was on his way to meet the designated driver. He had passengers on board.

Eyewitnesses say the driver, who did not have a driving license, of the minibus was trying to overtake another car before he veered off the road and overturned.

The deceased was identified as Alvera Nyirabuteri, 73, while the injured were rushed to Ruhengeri Hospital for treatment.

“Road users, especially drivers, should observe traffic rules, the conductor has no driving license and should not have been entrusted by the driver especially when he had people on board,” Munyaneza said.

The conductor is still on run and police say they will eventually catch up with him to ensure he is brought to book.
