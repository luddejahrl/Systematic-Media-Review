Eighteen people who sustained serious injuries during Tuesday’s fatal accident involving a Jaguar bus in Uganda’s southwest district of Ntungamo were yesterday transferred to Rwanda from Uganda’s Itojo Hospital.

Police officials said that some of the victims are admitted at Kibagabaga Hospital in Kigali City, while others are at Byumba Hospital, Gicumbi, Northern Province.

The accident, which killed three people including a Rwandan, happened at around 5.30am when the driver of Jaguar Bus Reg. No UAG 110T lost control and the coach overturned near Ntungamo town.

Of the eighteen victims admitted in Rwandan hospitals, eight are Burundians, seven Congolese, while the rest are Rwandans, the head of Rwanda Traffic Police, Robert Niyonshuti, said yesterday.

Those who died instantly are Rosette Mukamurahire (a Rwandan businesswoman), Aggrey Andrew Osuwere (Kenyan) and Abdullatif Kyalimpa, a Ugandan.

Julius Rusanga, a relative of the late Mukamurahire, 52, said that the body of their beloved one would be laid to rest at the Remera cemetery today. 
Mukamurahire has been the owner of among others Trekkers Lodge in Giporoso, Remera, a city suburb.

Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Osuwere has been a business associate with Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency (Riepa).
Niyonshuti said yesterday that police had issued stern regulations to bus companies to avoid accidents especially in this festive season.

“There is always a mistake that leads to an accident and we shall always hold the management of companies responsible; we have already asked them to discipline their drivers,” he said. The driver of the ill-fated bus, Joseph Kasozi, is said to have been asleep at the time of the accident.

The accident has sparked panic among Rwandans who are already in traveling mood as Christmas approaches.
