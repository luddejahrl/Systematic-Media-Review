KAMONYI - A bus carrying students of the National University of Rwanda (NUR) collided with another one Sunday, killing a three-month old baby on the spot and injuring 17 other passengers, Police confirmed.

The accident occurred at Karengera junction, in Musambira sector, Kamonyi district in the evening. The students’ bus reg. GR 244B was heading to Huye while the commuter omnibus was heading to Kigali.

The accident occurred when the university bus attempted to overtake a long haulage truck and in the process crushed into the passenger taxi bus (Reg. No.RAA 298P), according to Police.

“Passengers in the omnibus were seriously injured and their vehicle was completely destroyed. However, the students did not sustain major injuries, and were able to travel back to Butare,” an eyewitness said.

The injured passengers were rescued by paramedics from SAMU ambulances, Police and residents; and rushed to Kabgayi Hospital and Kigali University Hospital on the evening of the fatal incident.

The deceased boy was identified as David Mucyo, whose mother is currently unconscious and in intensive care. Rwanda Defense Forces (RDF) doctors and medical experts, who are participating in the ongoing army week, provided medical attention to most of the patients.

“Most passengers sustained various forms of injuries,” said Dr. Alphonse Niyodusenga. “We are handling the cases quite well but the complicated ones will be transferred to Kigali.”

Over 30 passengers were, last month, seriously injured when Cyangugu-bound Onatracom bus lost control and swayed off the road at the same spot in Musambira sector, along the Kigali-Butare highway.
