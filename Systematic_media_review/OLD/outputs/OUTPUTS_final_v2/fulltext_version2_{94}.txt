APR and the local handball fraternity are in deep sorrow following the sudden death of their player, Yvan Shimirwa, yesterday evening in a car accident.

The fatality occurred in Kayonza District between Kiziguro and Kiramuruzi trading centres as the deceased was travelling from Nyagatare District.

 Shimirwa died on spot while two others including the driver of the Fuso truck in which they were travelling have been admitted at the University Central Hospital of Kigali (CHUK).

The truck, which according to eyewitnesses, was loaded with grains, swerved off the road and overturned after the driver failed to negotiate a corner.

Shimirwa, 27, started his playing career at APR Handball Club after completing high school and according to relatives; he was set to join university this year.

APR Handball head coach, Anaclet Bagirishya, has described Shimirwa’s death as a great loss not only to his family but also his club, and the sports fraternity.

“It’s a difficult situation for us; he has been a good player, talented, social and humble. It is a big blow to us,” said Bagirishya
