Asylum seekers facing removal to Rwanda could have their claims processed in as little as three weeks from arrival, the High Court heard today - as more migrants were pictured arriving in Dover.

The charity Asylum Aid has brought a legal challenge against the Home Office, with judges told that the procedure is 'seriously unfair'.

In April, then-home secretary Priti Patel signed what she described as a 'world-first agreement' to deport some asylum seekers to the east African nation in a bid to deter migrants from crossing the Channel.

However, the first deportation flight - due to take off on June 14 - was grounded amid a series of legal challenges against individual removals and the policy as a whole.

Smugglers are charging migrants up to £2,800 each - as total to cross in four years passes 75,000 Migrants are paying people smugglers up to £2,800 per person to reach the UK amid a shortage of boats, according to new reports today. Even so, the issues do not seem to be holding back the tide of crossings, with another 800 migrants making the perilous journey across the English Channel yesterday. The latest arrivals bring the total so far this year to 36,463 people in 899 boats - an average of 41 people per vessel. It also means more than 75,000 migrants have arrived in Britain after crossing the Channel since current records began four years ago.

Charlotte Kilroy KC, for Asylum Aid, told the High Court in London today that the process is 'highly abbreviated' and lacks safeguards.

Ms Kilroy said in written submissions: 'It is intended, absent delays introduced by legal challenges, to be capable of completion 'end to end', i.e. from start to removal, within two-three weeks.

'The procedure is seriously unfair and gives rise to a real risk that individuals may be removed from the jurisdiction without having had effective access to legal advice and thus to the courts.'

The court heard that after a notice of intent is issued, asylum seekers are given seven days' notice of their planned removal to Rwanda, which is increased to 14 days if the person is not in detention.

The Home Office will then make a decision, which may be accompanied by the formal removal direction that requires five working days' notice before the proposed removal date, judges later heard.

'There is a real problem with not giving people enough time to put their full case which has a chance of succeeding,' said Ms Kilroy.

'Seven, or even 14 days, is far too short a period to afford an effective opportunity to gather evidence and make representations on the wide range of complex issues raised,' she continued in written submissions.

Extensions are possible, the barrister argued, but 'individuals are not informed that they may seek extensions, there is no policy or guidance to case workers on granting them, and they are granted for short periods on a restrictive basis, if at all'.

The Home Office has argued that seven days will be 'sufficient' in many cases and that individuals and their solicitors can request extensions.

'It is not an 'accelerated' process or a 'mirror' of any other system,' Edward Brown KC, for the department, said in written arguments.

He continued: 'The process is designed to determine, without delay, the issue of admissibility and possible removal to Rwanda, whilst giving sufficient opportunity to the individual to make representations in relation to that decision.

'Any notionally longer standard time period, none having been identified, would inevitably disrupt the balance with other critical factors, such as the fact of immigration detention and the wider public interest in asylum, immigration and border control.'

'The time periods are flexible and adequate to the procedure in question,' he added.

Mr Brown later said in written arguments: 'The relevant question is whether the period, including any extension, is sufficient for the purpose in question. The evidence demonstrates that it is.'

'In many cases, seven days will be sufficient, particularly if an applicant chooses to make no representations ... In more complex cases, a longer period may be necessary,' the barrister added.

Last month, several asylum seekers - along with the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) and groups Care4Calais and Detention Action - told judges at the High Court that Rwanda is an 'authoritarian state' which 'tortures and murders those it considers to be its opponents'.

However, Home Office lawyers argued that the Rwandan authorities have given 'detailed assurances' over the processing of asylum claims and the ongoing treatment of individuals.

The hearing before Lord Justice Lewis and Mr Justice Swift is due to finish on Friday, with judgment in both cases expected at a later date.

It is a modest, but historic beginning. Seven countries are now leading where it is hoped all of Africa will follow, as they move the first traded goods, under African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) regulations.

The products to be traded are almost incidental, to the highly momentous symbolism of the first trades in Africa, to be traded within Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).

Indeed, in years to come, there may be quiz games, where people will struggle to name the first products to be traded under AfCFTA trade agreements. The correct answer then, will be coffee, tea, sugar, pharmaceutical products, manufactured household goods, like kitchenware, and steel.

The agreement that would create the world’s biggest free trade area, was signed in 2018, in the Rwandan capital, Kigali. Following the signing, 43, of the 54 African nations, ratified the agreement, with 39, including Rwanda, recognised as ready to trade under the agreement.

Trading within the AfCFTA framework, could technically have begun in January 2021, but little was done, beyond a few shipments, as examples of what could be done.

The AfCFTA Guided Trade Initiative is a pilot project, launched by the Ghana based AfCFTA Secretariat, to kickstart trade between those countries that have demonstrated readiness to start trading with each other, under the agreement.

The seven, Cameroon, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda and Tanzania, will blaze the trail for others, demonstrating what needs to be done to smooth out the processes, from individual countries’ agreed tariff concessions, to proposed rules of origin of goods to be traded.

It is a beginning of what could be a transformative process for the continent. The AfCFTA envisages free trade agreements, in a market of over 1.2billion people, with a combined GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of over $3trillion.

More than 60 years ago, the visionary first president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, called for African unity, declaring that Africa’s political independence would mean nothing, if not accompanied by economic independence.

For the upbeat AfCFTA Secretary-General, Wamkele Mene, Nkrumah’s call has begun to be answered. He gives coffee and tea, as just one example of what stands to be gained, if Africa develops its markets, and trades with itself.

“The global market for coffee and tea is estimated to be worth over $100billion” he pointed out, “the processing and packaging is done elsewhere, outside our continent, and you can see the losses in the value chain.”

The implementation of the AfCFTA, he added, is a beginning of reversing a trend that has been in place for more than the last sixty years.Topeka police officers shot and killed a man early Thursday after he walked toward them with a knife as they tried to intervene in a carjacking, authorities say.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a news release that a woman called 911 around 12:30 a.m. to report that a 33-year-old family member, Taylor Lowery, was inside the home, armed with a knife and behaving erratically.

She was able to escape, and Lowery drove away from the home in a sport utility vehicle, according to the KBI, which is investigating.

Officers spotted him a short time later at a gas station convenience store, where they saw him attempting to steal a car with a woman and infant inside.

The KBI said officers repeatedly ordered him to drop the knife he was holding. When he advanced toward the officers with the weapon, five of them fired, striking Lowery multiple times, the KBI said.

Communities living around the Volcanoes National Park in Musanze have raised alarm over increased cases of attacks by buffaloes.

The buffalos, the communities said, have on several occasions killed a number of people and le others injured.

The latest victim is Semivumbi Felicien, a 70-year-old resident of Shingiro sector in Musanze District, who succumbed to injuries of a recent buffalo attack.

The old man was out harvesting hay for his cows when two buffalos from the park attacked him, severely injuring him. He was rushed to the hospital but died shortly after.

The two buffaloes, according to eyewitnesses, were later shot and killed by a RDF soldier to thwart further fatalities. But residents say there was negligence and delayed reaction on the part of security and authorities, that had they responded with urgency, the old man wouldn’t have died.

“We called them as early as 5am when the buffalos had just broken out but no action was taken, they kept waiting for permission from higher authorities which never came, its as if these animals have more value than us the people,”

“It wasn’t until 10am, after the old man had been attacked that one soldier took it upon himself to shoot them,” said one of the residents.

An eyewitness said the soldier shot the buffalo at a point it was about to enter into another homestead to ravage people there.

“After shooting them he was actually verbally attacked by one of his colleagues in security force, a police officer who said he didn’t have permission to kill them,” said a resident who witnessed everything.

Attacks by buffalos and other animals that break out of the park and go into the community has been around for years.

But there seem to be no solution from line authorities even after they kill people, destroy crops and livestock as well as other property.

In May, another buffalo broke out of the park and wreaked havoc Musanze town severely wounding three people, with one of the victims succumbing to the injuries.

In 2019 a 14 year old boy, Phocas Manizabayo, was also attacked and injured by a buffalo in Kinigi sector in Musanze District.

“We call upon RDB to take immediate action by putting a strong fence around the park like what was done in Akagera, this is getting out of hand, we can’t continue losing our people like this,” said an angry resident.

Residents also asked the government to ensure that families that have lost their loved ones and those whose crops and property have been destroyed in buffalo attacks are adequately compensated.

“We need advocacy so we can be helped, RDB as the line institution should take responsibility, for instance as we speak the family of the deceased doesn’t even have money to get the body from hospital, these families should also be adequately compensated and on time” said Ntawujera Jeanclaude, a local leader in Shingiro.

Télesphore Ngoga, a Conservation Analyst at Rwanda Development Board (RDB) told Rwanda Today that a stone wall and a wide trench have been put along the park boundary but some areas remained uncovered or poorly covered and these are the loopholes exploited by the buffalos.

“While putting these physical measures in place, some areas have remained uncovered or poorly covered”

“Those with shallow rocks difficult to build or dig, those without easy access to stones and those with wide talwegs (dry rivers) where construction requires heavier techniques,” he said.

He says they have worked with the local communities who patrol the stone fence and repair where animals can force and break out, and that this has gone along with sustained awareness around the park community.Asmani Dadi had heard rumors about the insurgents. Then, one day, they came true.

It was July 2020 and Dadi was a student in the town of Mocímboa da Praia, northern Mozambique.

“They came … from the forest and began to kill people. When they found children, … they stole them back to the forest. And when they find men… they cut off their heads,” Dadi recalled.

The attack was just one in a festering insurgency by ISIS-linked militants in the southern African nation that has killed at least 4000 civilians and displaced nearly one million people, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency, UNHCR.

“They first arrived in this area to spread their propaganda. To say they were Muslim men. But Muslim men should not kill like this,” said Dadi.

Rich natural resource

Mozambique has huge natural gas reserves – a resource that, if exploited effectively, could change its fortunes and help the world as it struggles to find enough natural gas to heat homes and fuel industry following Russia’s war on Ukraine. The insurgency, however, jeopardizes Mozambique’s entire economic future, and the battle against the militants is now international.

Soldiers and military personnel from 10 nations are combating the fighters. Among them are Rwandan forces that have now largely regained control of a portion of Mozambique’s northernmost Cabo Delgado province, which is home to Palma and Mocímboa da Praia.

Whether Mozambique and its allies can stamp out the insurgency altogether is a question that has global repercussions as countries hunt for new sources of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Mozambique is one of the poorest nations on earth but its offshore riches could make it one of the richest countries in the region. In early 2010, an enormous gas field was discovered in the Rovuma basin, near Mozambique’s border with Tanzania.

Mozambique has huge natural gas reserves which, if managed effectively, could transform its fortunes.

With already more than 100 trillion cubic feet of proven offshore natural gas reserves, one industry insider likened its future potential equal to Russia – a natural gas giant.

Story continues

As the European Union attempts to wean itself off Russian LNG after President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the need for future sources from non-aligned countries like Mozambique is critical, says Paul Eardley-Taylor, director of Oil & Gas, Southern Africa at Standard Bank.

“Mozambique is important as it’s a very large find; has low CO2 gas; is an ideal geography for Southeast Asia but can also service Europe and East Asia,” he said.

Many industry experts see LNG as an ideal transition fuel as countries move from coal to renewable energy to combat climate change, though some climate activists believe that the transition should skip LNG entirely because even as a cleaner source of fuel, it does contribute to global warming.

In practical terms, the world will depend on LNG supply in the foreseeable future. And the war in Ukraine has rattled expectations of both price and supply.

“Gas prices are upwards of anywhere to eight times what they were before the invasion of Ukraine. Not just prices, but the availability of supply. The ability for the world markets to have more gas available – especially LNG – is huge,” said a senior US State Department diplomat who closely watches Mozambique.

After the find, major oil suppliers such as TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, and others flooded in.

Mozambique faced a radical transformation; the government promised human development would be at the center of its strategy. But without much delay, several officials became embroiled in a corruption scandal worth billions of dollars.

But a far more deadly threat was brewing.

The making of ISIS-Mozambique

On the ridge above Mocímboa da Praia, the market stalls are just burnt-out husks, evidence of the battle to retake the town from the ISIS-linked fighters.

They held Mocímboa for a year until Rwandan forces pushed them out. But the earliest known insurgent attacks in the country occurred in late 2017.

At first, small groups of men struck with clubs and machetes. They seemed to capture weapons from the Mozambican police and military at will. Machetes became AK-47s; AK-47s became RPGs and grenades.

The group began calling for followers online and started attacking bigger towns. Their awful signature became beheading security forces and civilians to sow terror.

Known as Ansar al-Sunnah wa al Jamma’ah, or Shabaab (no connection to the Somali group of the same name), in 2021 the US State Department branded the militants as ISIS-Mozambique.

Their motivations, organizational structure, and leadership remain opaque.

“It is really important to emphasize how little is known. And the intelligence deficit has been a central challenge for the government and security forces in dealing with this insurgency,” said Piers Pigou, a senior consultant for Southern Africa at the International Crisis Group (ICG).

In March last year, the militants staged one of their most brazen attacks and overran the town of Palma in Cabo Delgado, leaving behind a trail of bodies, some beheaded.

Few security analysts publicly believed a successful attack was possible, as a substantial force of Mozambican military was posted in the area.

The militants had activated sleeper cells in the economic hub, however, and attacked from three different directions.

During the raid, ISIS-Mozambique destroyed a cell tower to cut communications and beheaded several truck drivers on the routes into Palma, robbing banks and looting stores as they went.

The Mozambican forces, as had happened multiple times in smaller towns, were unable to stop them. Many Mozambican and foreign workers sought refuge in the Amarula hotel.

Over the space of several days, a South African mercenary group evacuated some of them. Others set up a convoy to make a desperate escape. They were ambushed on their way out.

Scores were killed in the Palma attack and thousands displaced, many scrambling onto boats to get to Pemba, the regional capital. Government forces eventually regained control. But people were too scared to come back.

The attack had devastating economic consequences. TotalEnergies declared force majeure (a case of unforeseeable circumstances that prevent it from fulfilling a contract) and shut down its vast Afungi gas development nearby.

The Mozambican government, long accused of downplaying the insurgency, faced the very real prospect of losing both its economic future and the entire province of Cabo Delgado to ISIS-Mozambique.

The Mozambican government did not reply to requests for comment on this story.

An unlikely savior

The Mozambican military and police had struggled to combat the insurgents from the very start. Despite a brutal civil war after independence in 1975, or perhaps because of it, their forces have appeared demotivated and undersupplied according to multiple outside observers.

But foreign forces from nearby countries have now stepped in.

Standing amongst the perfect rows of prefabricated housing on the Afungi site is Brig. Gen. Ronald Rwivanga, of the Rwandan Defence Force. With him are a group of journalists, including CNN, embedded with the Rwandan forces in a rare opportunity to get into Cabo Delgado.

“The first stage will be to show the population that you have militarily defeated the insurgents. The next step should be to rebuild lives. To ensure that everybody feels that sense of security. And that requires you to be present. The forces have to be there,” Rwivanga told CNN.

Rwandan military and police have secured a large swath of land between Palma and Mocímboa da Praia and into the interior. Southern African forces, as part of a regional block deployment, are tasked with other zones.

They eventually got here after a series of half-measures and failed solutions.

The EU has given substantial financial backing, and the United States and the European bloc have supplied training, but the outcomes are still spotty.

In a bid to stamp out the insurgency, the Mozambican government looked to the outside, first hiring the notorious Wagner Group, Russian mercenaries with links to the Kremlin.

It later engaged the Dyke Advisory Group (DAG), a small mercenary operation led by Lionel Dyck, a former colonel in the Zimbabwe military.

In the wake of the attack on Palma and the halting of Mozambique’s gas potential, the Mozambican government needed to find a solution quickly.

The answer came from Paul Kagame, long-time president of Rwanda and, famously, former military commander. At the invitation of Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi, Rwanda dispatched frontline forces and specialized police to Cabo Delgado in July 2021.

Their progress was swift as they attacked major insurgent-controlled towns and base camps, retaking Mocímboa in August 2021.

‘I heard there is peace now’

A year on, the Rwandan officers are at pains to show that their area of control is returning to normalcy.

There is some evidence of that. On the roads leading into their former villages, trucks, and buses ladened with the belongings of returning people stream steadily by.

“They were burning houses, killing people everywhere. I was with my family when I saw them doing it, so we had to run,” said Benjamin Thomas, who is sitting in the back of a white truck, as the passengers pass around a bottle of water in the stifling heat, “I heard there is peace now, so I came home.”

Thomas and others said they came back to find what was left and to escape what they say are terrible conditions in the sprawling camps for the displaced to the south of Mozambique.

Schools are still closed in much of the region after teachers and administrators fled, and health care, neglected even before the insurgency, is sorely lacking.

Some human rights activists are suspicious that just enough is being done for the gas projects to restart without a public relations backlash.

“There is a prioritization of optics for the world to see that these areas are fine and therefore investment should come, rather than a prioritization of basic conditions for people to go back,” said Zenaida Machado, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch.

“Being surrounded by soldiers is not normalcy,” she told CNN.

It is a sensitive topic for TotalEnergies and at Afungi their representatives were not authorized to speak.

“The situation is getting better, but the restart of our project in Afungi is conditional on the restoration of security in a sustainable way in northern Cabo Delgado and the normalization of the situation with regard to the local population,” a TotalEnergies representative said in a written statement to questions from CNN.

A spokesperson for Eni, the Italian energy company, confirmed to CNN that a separate LNG development of a offshore floating LNG ship called Coral Sul began LNG production this year and its first cargo is expected this quarter.

But the situation on land,, in much of the province and beyond, is still very volatile.

It is unfortunately a kind of whack-a-mole approach. If you hit them here, they pop up there,” said Pigou of ICG.

Together with his team, Pigou has been tracking multiple recent incidents, including deadly attacks and beheadings, mostly outside of the Rwandan zone of control.

There is also growing evidence of closer ties to ISIS in the Middle East and the move towards terror tactics like improvised explosive devices, say Pigou and Joe van Der Walt, CEO of Focus Group, a South African risk management company.

“The security situation has changed, and the dynamics have changed, but the insurgents themselves have demonstrated a propensity for adaptation and survival,” said the senior State Department diplomat, adding that ISIS-Mozambique is still actively recruiting and training inside the province and beyond.

They stress that developing the region, giving people something to hope for, is the key to extinguishing the threat of ISIS-Mozambique before it takes the well-trodden path of insurgencies in other regions of the continent like the Sahel and Somalia.

Most agree that the window to stamp out the insurgency is narrow.

“The first thing about dealing with an insurgency is that you must deal with the root causes of the insurgency. Of course, the very first thing you must do is defeat the insurgents in a military operation, but after that, you must try to win hearts and minds,” said Rwivanga.

There are some facts happening in the world that are extremely serious, but very few media talk about them. Few weeks ago, for example, shocking news from the Democratic Republic of Congo has passed silently.

On July 26 in Goma, responding to North Kivu people’s protests against MONUSCO (the United Nations Stabilization Organization Mission in the DR Congo), the UN peacekeepers opened fire at head height against the crowd. At least 12 demonstrators and 3 UN soldiers died, about 50 people were injured.

A few days later, on 31 July in Kassindi, on the border between DR Congo and Uganda, “for inexplicable reasons” UN intervention brigade’s soldiers, returning from leave of absence, opened fire against the border outpost. The number of fatalities and injured is unknown. According to rumors, Blue Helmets refused to register at the border, perhaps because they were hiding something or someone in the tanks that should not be discovered.

If the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo does not seem to catch mainstream’s interest per se, this time media did not tell that the killers were those who should protect the population, those paid by us to guarantee peace, the “good guys. Why?

John Mpaliza, an Italian-Congolese activist, commented: “I had to ask to stop sending me videos of the bloody and atrocious crimes in my country. I can’t even show many of them to my partner. It is ridiculous that the general press does not talk about what is happening in DR Congo. But it is quite eloquent that RAI (Italian Public TV) has no longer reporters in the south of the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to get information, you only can check Aljazeera and a few other media. Many bishops keep denouncing the occupation of eastern Congo’s territories by Rwandan-speaking groups that are trying to replace the original peoples. They denounce massacres, house burnings, rapes as a weapon of war. But nobody stops these crimes”.

In the shadow of Russia-Ukraine conflict, while it is said that this war will change the geopolitical structure of the planet, many other wars fought in “third theaters” are neglected. Those wars clearly show the world is divided into two halves. They also show that stronger countries look after their own interests while they destroy and starve minor countries. One of these wars is the one in DR Congo, which has been defined a “civil war”, or “ethnic” or “between groups including Islamist ones”. A war often dismissed as too complicated to understand and resolve, and which instead has very specific historical origins and actors. Furthermore, it is taking place, not by chance, only in the eastern region of the country: North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri. This is the area with the richest subsoil in the world. There are cassiterite, gold, oil and the famous coltan, which is very precious for high-tech companies: it optimizes chips energy’s consumption, so it improves our phones and computers battery life. It is the same area where the Italian ambassador Luca Attanasio, his escort carabiniere Vittorio Iacovacci and his driver Mustapha Milambo were murdered while they were traveling in an unprotected convoy of the UN World Food Program agency. Not even their death has brought world attention to seek the truth behind what happens every day in Congo. And coincidentally, Pope Francis’ trip, who was expected to visit the area at the beginning of last July, did not happen.

How many times do we ask ourselves why countries like Congo are so rich in minerals and water and instead their people die of hunger and thirst? And why have we been told for weeks with a pietistic attitude about the agreements allowing ships loaded of Ukrainian cereals leave from Odessa in order to feed Africa, while most of the press deliberately ignores the atrocities that are being committed in the continent?

Consciences and common thinking are probably relieved by the idea that UN missions are in the hot spots of the conflict. Unfortunately, however, MONUSCO several times has been accused of very serious crimes and for this reason the Congolese citizens and politicians are asking for its withdrawal. Now even more, after the two recent shootings documented with chilling videos. This time we cannot get confused, it was not a matter of battles between rebels or irregular indefinite armies, this time Blue Helmets killed civilians with their weapons. Why UN didn’t open internal investigations? About 1Billion dollars a year is spent on MONUSCO. Why the 193 UN countries that are paying for it did not say anything about UN soldiers crimes?

Pierre Kabeza, a Congolese political refugee in Italy, former trade union activist for the right to education of all children in Congo, explains: “Blue Helmets crimes in Congo have been committed for years and have been documented with videos and photos. There is violence against women, including young girls, and illicit trafficking in minerals such as gold and coltan. Congolese civil society and even the church have accused them many times. Furthermore, Congolese citizens have never felt protected by MONUSCO since the beginning of the mission. Blue Helmets have always appeared inert in front of everyday massacres”.

John Mpaliza and Pierre Kabeza both say MONUSCO’s disengagement is necessary but with a peaceful exit agenda. “Missions have a beginning and an end and this one also proved it failed”, says Mpaliza. United States are the main UN financiers and their only response in this regard was they asked DR Congo government to guarantee security to Blue Helmets (which should guarantee the safety of the Congolese!). They also asked to keep the UN troops on the territory for at least other 15 years. Meanwhile, a video circulating on social media apparently show new Blue Helmets getting off an Ethiopian Airlines plane landed at Goma airport.

At this point the question is: are United Nations in good health? Have they shown to work during their 77 years of life? How did UN get to the point MONUSCO soldiers rape women, smuggle minerals, shoot civilians while they are supposed to guarantee peace and protection in Congo?

“United Nations first problem is systemic”, explains Roberto Savio, journalist and expert in multilateralism and international cooperation. “The 5 founding countries, USA, Russia, China, England and France, are Security Council’s permanent members. Security Council has the final word on any proposal. The rule says that in order to deliberate unanimity is required. If only one of the 5 countries puts its veto, any resolution doesn’t go through. This didn’t allow UN to work as an executive guarantor of peace and protection so far, and you can read it in its Statute. Despite International Law and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it happens that in case of an “inconvenient” proposal, any Security Council member can block it with its veto making prevail its own interests. In addition to that, there is another problem pretty unknown. Even if war crimes or crimes against humanity are detected and documented, not all UN countries have ratified the agreements that allow Hague Tribunal to have authority in their territory. There is a lot of talk about Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine for example. Biden himself points the finger but neither Russia, nor Ukraine, nor even the United States recognize the international criminal Court of the Hague. Nor China. That means three out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and they are the most influential”.

This explains the absurd situation in DR Congo, where all five permanent members of the Security Council have strong economic interests.

What is really happening in Congo?

Pierre Kabeza used a suggestive image: “We can represent this war as a tree in the forest.

The roots are hidden, they are underground, they cannot be seen, they are the multinationals and behind them there are big countries like USA, Israel, England, Europe. The roots feed the trunk which is visible up close and includes all Congo’s neighboring countries: Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Angola. The branches and leaves can be seen from afar and they are the armed groups making war with each other fed by the trunk. All the parts are then nourished by the sap: economic interests “.

Furthermore, in addition to western bloc countries, in Congo there are also the so-called BRICs: Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa under the shield of China. Or even BRICSIA, as the journalist Raffaele Crocco called them, adding Iran and Argentina. The presence of China was legitimized by the former president Kabila himself who at that time signed an agreement: China would provide for the construction of infrastructure for almost 9 Billion dollars. In compensation, China would thus legitimately acquire the right to put its hands to the resources of Congolese subsoil. Kabeza’s comment: “We have to understand that in Congo took place the African World War, as it has been called”.

John Mpaliza explained: “The situation in DR Congo cannot be understood without reconstructing at least the last 40 years of country’s history”. Mpaliza tells how the Congo in particular was one of the key countries in Cold War’s chessboard, it is meaningfull Che Guevara had helped to organize its revolution.

Even before the Cold War there were two US military bases in Congo. Uranium used to build Nagasaki and Hiroshima atomic bombs was taken in Katanga. Then, behind the thirty-years presidency of the “anti-communist” dictator Mobutu, successor of the assassinated prime minister Lumumba, United States were orienting country’s political fortunes with the precise objective of seeking coltan this time: a fundamental mineral for technology and strategic for the Pentagon. Later, Soviet Union’s collapse after Berlin Wall’s fall made United States easier to get stronger in Central Africa. Taking advantage of the ethnic conflict in Rwanda in 1994 and the war in Congo in 1996, the US helped in replacing Mobutu with Laurent-Désiré Kabila in order to strengthen their economic position.

Globalization subsequently intensified the presence of multinational companies and labor exploitation at very low cost. Children are employed in the mines, at least those who have not become Kadogo (in Swhaili “the very little ones”), that are the child soldiers recruited by more than 100 armies fighting in eastern Congo.

From that moment on, subsoil exploitation and the attempt to balkanize the country started, explains Mpaliza: “This is why we Congolese think that Congo’s invasion by Rwanda with Uganda and Burundi was not a coincidence. It was something planned that included the massacres in Rwanda and also those in Congo. It is estimated that 10 Million Congolese have been killed so far”.

At this point, in 1999 UN mission and Blue Helmets presence in east RD Congo begun with the function of observers and later with the hybrid one of peacekeepers. In fact, it was United Nations who wanted the Mapping Report, a very detailed dossier documenting all the horrible crimes committed in Congo from 1993 to 2003. More than 6 Million victims, however, did not get justice because that report was locked up in a drawer. There were involved such uncomfortable people and countries that any disposition to proceed would be blocked by the veto of one or another UN Security Council permanent member. It is eloquent that the current DR Congo president Félix Tshisekedi denies Mapping Report’s validity. It would inevitably prove the responsibility of many personalities still present in country’s political and military landscape.

The president has also decided to “start from scratch” with Rwanda and Uganda and he signed secret economic agreements with them, somehow legalizing Congolese minerals looting. Mpaliza comments: “Rwanda and Uganda’s common economic interest in Congo unites them. They can pretend to argue with each other but when it is time to act against Congo they do it together”.

Another question is: who arms the actors of the war in Congo?

The fact that Rwandan M23 irregular army’s extremely sophisticated weapons are much more powerful than MONUSCO’s suggests that they are supplied by super powers such as USA, Canada, Europe, England and Israel. A fact that makes the UN established arms embargo in Congo useless and meaningless. It looks like Congo cannot arm itself while its neighboring aggressors can. At the beginning of July, UN Council split precisely on this issue with France on one side and England and the USA on the other. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has reportedly signed an agreement to send unwanted migrants to Rwanda and they would likely end up being militarily conscripted.

Looking at our home, Italy apparently trains Rwandan military and Leonardo sells military helicopters to the Ugandan army. Furthermore, last February there was a parliamentary question on the weapons sold by Italy to Uganda.

In a few words, it is “the white tribe” the one who does harm to DR Congo, as Padre Alex Zanotelli said. But it is not alone: the neighboring countries are internal enemies along with rampant corruption. In 2023 there should be next political elections, how should they go to encourage hope? Kabeza and Mpaliza responded in the same way: crimes in Congo must be recognized, victims must have justice and national and international political will must build peace and true democracy through dialogue. In order to do this, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege, the doctor who has treated and saved thousands of raped women in Congo, should run and win the elections. A group of Congolese intellectuals signed a petition asking him to candidate. His moral stature, the fact that he is internationally known, that he has has access to the world’s highest political spheres and that he keeps denouncing the crimes committed in his country, make him the key man who could write the new history of Democratic Republic of Congo. There’s one doubt though: would the “white tribe” allow it?
