Between fatal and ghastly - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/between-fatal-and-ghastly/,['As a result of the current socio-political events in Nigeria  some expressions are regularly used. The security situation as well as the elections has  for instance  made certain terms recurrent. We have in recent times been focusing on such in this English class  exploiting them to set some grammatical records straight. We are still operating in this realm today.\n\nReprisal attack?\n\nEach time a group attacks another  there is the fear that the victims will fight back one way or the other. The anxiety is worse when the military is attacked. This is the case with the killing of two soldiers in Abonema  Rivers State  some days ago. As soon as the unfortunate incident (not incidence) happened  many people  including media men  began to express the fear of a reprisal attack.\n\nThat is the language many of us use in similar situations – reprisal attack. Indeed  in a statement released by the military  I think on Friday  in which it allayed the fear of communities where its men have been killed  it also used the expression  saying it would not carry out any reprisal attack on the people. A fantastic decision by the army  but there is a problem with the phrase  in the sense that it carries needless repetition.\n\nThe word  reprisal is a noun. In the context under consideration  it means an attack launched as a retaliation to an assault earlier unleashed on one by the receivers. According to the Oxford Advanced Dictionary  for example  reprisal is an act of retaliation’ with the dictionary giving an example thus:\n\nThree youths died in the reprisals which followed’\n\n‘Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English’ also defines the word as ‘something violent or harmful which you do to punish someone for something bad they have done to you. Examples:\n\nThey didn’t tell the police for fear of reprisal. (Not ‘for fear of reprisal attack’)\n\nThere were reprisals against unarmed civilians. (Not reprisal attacks against’)\n\nAlfred was shot in reprisal for the killing of a rival gang member.\n\nWhat this suggests is that you do not need to attach ‘attack’ to the word before it can make the full sense of the implied revenge. When you add the term to it  you are only joining the league of people who celebrate tautology:\n\nThe Abonema people fear the army will launch a reprisal attack against them. (Wrong)\n\nThe Abonema people fear the army will launch a reprisal against them. (Correct)\n\nMany militants were killed in the reprisal attack. (wrong)\n\nMany militants were killed in the reprisal. (Correct)\n\nBetween ghastly and fatal\n\nOne of the terrible stories of our lives as Nigerians is the high incidence of road accidents we have to cope with. Statistics of deaths resulting from road crashes are simply appalling. In having to constantly talk and write about the ugly occurrences  we also constantly mix up the words  ghastly and fatal.\n\nIt is true that both of them are adjectives (words that modify or describe nouns) and they collocate (work) with accident. But they do not mean the same thing. This means that there will be trouble when you use them indiscriminately. In this wise  what is your view about the two clauses below?\n\nThe FRSC boss said five passengers died. It was such a ghastly accident.\n\nIt was a fatal accident. But  thank God  all the people on the buses involved survived.\n\nI should give you a few minutes to study the clauses? Sorry!\n\nA fatal accident is one that involves the loss of a life or more. On the other hand  a ghastly accident is one that is also terrible and horrific but without the loss of any life. In other words  you must be sure of the extent of the tragedy of an accident before you describe it as fatal or ghastly. This means that there is a problem in each of the clauses above. The fact is that the one in which five people died is fatal while the other in which all the people  survived is ghastly.\n\nPotential WASSCE and UTME candidates should particularly note the difference because the examiners often test their mastery of the meanings of the words.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Mass shooting in CIncinnati: 9 wounded in front of Over-the-Rhine bar,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/08/07/over-rhine-mass-shooting-police-looking-suspect/10260203002/,"['OTR mass shooting injures 9: \'None of us can sleep\'\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption \'You\'re not going to get away with it:\' Mayor  police release details about OTR shooting Cincinnati mayor Aftab Pureval  councilman Scotty Johnson and police officials discuss the mass shooting that injured nine in OTR early Sunday. Fox 19  Enquirer Media partner\n\nNine people were wounded when a shooting exploded in a crowd in Cincinnati\'s Over-the-Rhine early Sunday morning  police said.\n\nPolice have not made any arrests  but said they are searching for ""at least two"" people who fired weapons during the incident.\n\nAll of the people who were shot were treated and released from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center on Sunday. The names of the injured have not been released. Officials said they range in age from 24 to 47; eight are men and one is a woman.\n\n""I thank God there were no fatalities "" Mayor Aftab Pureval said at a press conference Sunday.\n\nPureval credited the quick response of police who were already at the scene  including the officer who fired his weapon at one of the suspected shooters.\n\n""Our police officer responded with heroic and immediate action "" the mayor said.\n\nLt. Col. Mike John said it is unclear if any of the suspects were among the nine wounded but encouraged anyone with information about what happened to report it to police.\n\nWhat happened in latest Over-the-Rhine shooting\n\nThe corner of Main Street and Woodward is in the heart of Over-the-Rhine\'s entertainment district. There are dozens of bars  restaurants and clubs in the area. Thousands of people come to the neighborhood every weekend.\n\nPolice said that just after 1:30 a.m. officers assigned to the Civil Disturbance Response Team came to the corner to disperse a large crowd. While officers were at the scene  shots rang out. John said surveillance video showed a physical altercation in the crowd and then a suspect firing into it.\n\nCincinnati OTR shooting: Security camera footage shows people running  sound of gunshots\n\nCincinnati Police Officer Joseph Shook fired one round at one of the shooting suspects who then fled  John said. After that suspect fled toward Zeigler Park  and more shots were heard coming from the south on Main Street leading police to believe at least two people fired.\n\nSecurity camera footage shows people running  sound of gunshots after OTR mass shooting A security camera near the corner of 13th and Main streets captured this footage early Sunday morning. Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nShook joined the police department in 2016  John said.\n\n""He acted immediately "" John said. ""He ran toward gunfire.""\n\nJohn said his actions and the actions of other first responders saved lives.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting  the large crowd remained and police were struggling to make way for medics  John said.\n\nSome officers used ""bang balls "" loud explosives that are rolled on the ground  to move the crowd back quickly  John said. Other officers found people who had been shot and started rendering first aid. In recent years  officers have been carrying tourniquets for situations just like this  and John said several were used by officers on Main Street.\n\nCincinnati councilman calls for accountability\n\nCincinnati City Councilman Scotty Johnson is a former police officer. He spoke to the press Sunday.\n\nHe said a small number of people cannot seem to solve their problems or disputes without reaching for a gun. Johnson said the people and business owners in Over-the-Rhine do not deserve to become victims due to these individuals\' ""ridiculous beefs.""\n\nSupport local journalism. Subscribe to the Enquirer today to access all of our content online at https://cm.cincinnati.com/specialoffer.\n\n""We want everyone to come Downtown and have a good time "" he said. ""You are making it unsafe for everyone. You\'re not going to get away with it.""\n\nHe called for ""personal accountability."" He said people need to find better ways to settle their arguments and anyone who knows anything about what happened should come forward to police with the information.\n\n""We are a better city than this "" Johnson said.\n\nWhat\'s next for Cincinnati policing after latest shooting\n\nThe police department had seen things changing on Main Street and was already taking action  John said.\n\nJohn said patrols in the area were increased over the past month due to more large crowds forming on Main Street. He said staffing has not been an issue and the city has been ""generous"" with its budget for overtime.\n\nPureval said the city will keep exploring options to expand conflict resolution programs and has already funded new police recruit classes.\n\nThe mayor said more and more of the gun violence in the city is not centered around drug trafficking  which is a big shift from the past.\n\nRecently high-profile shootings like the killing in the parking lot of an Oakley Target  the shooting at Smale Park on July 4  2021  and a shooting in Grant Park the year before all stemmed from personal disputes  according to police.\n\n""The gun violence is so inappropriate "" Pureval said. ""People can\'t solve their difference without reaching for a gun.""\n\nHe said the prevalence of guns in the community is contributing to the problem and said better mental health resources and conflict resolution training are needed.\n\n""We need people to call the police when they\'re having a disagreement "" he said.\n\nPureval said that Cincinnati is not alone in this ""devasting trend.""\n\n""This is all across the country "" he said.\n\nOTR business owner: \'None of us can sleep\'\n\nThe shooting is Greater Cincinnati\'s fourth mass shooting of 2022.\n\nThe FBI defines a mass shooting as any shooting with four or more victims.\n\nThe shooting near Main and 13th streets had more casualties than any shooting in the city since the Cameo nightclub shooting in 2017. In that incident  two people died and 17 people were injured at the East End club.\n\nThere have been 18 people shot in Over-the-Rhine so far this year  of those  17 survived. There was a double shooting in June in the same block as Sunday\'s shooting  and a triple shooting in the 1700 block of Vine Street earlier this month.\n\nLindsey Swadner owns The Hub at 12th and Main streets. She said her employees and neighbors are traumatized.\n\n""I\'ve witnessed non-stop shootings "" Swadner said. ""None of us can sleep.""\n\nShe said she\'s even had a gun pulled on her when she asked someone to leave the property.\n\nShe said bartenders and employees in Over-the-Rhine need counseling and mental health support after the things they\'ve witnessed. Swadner praised City Council for being responsive and listening  and acknowledged that police can respond to crime  but not necessarily prevent it.\n\n""I\'m on the other end of it ... trying to make sure my bartenders aren\'t sobbing hysterically and freaking out about whether it\'s safe to go home "" Swadner said.\n\n""I don\'t know if I\'ll open "" she said. ""Putting my bartenders in that position when they just saw a mass shooting ... is kind of horrible.""']",otr mass shoot injures none u sleep n nshow caption hide caption go get away mayor police release detail otr shoot cincinnati mayor aftab pureval councilman scotty johnson police official discuss mass shooting injured nine otr early sunday fox enquirer medium partner n nnine people wound shoot explode crowd cincinnati rhine early sunday morning police say n npolice make arrest say search least two people fire weapon incident n nall people shoot treat release university cincinnati medical center sunday name injure release official say range age eight men one woman n n thank god fatalities mayor aftab pureval say press conference sunday n npureval credit quick response police already scene include officer fire weapon one suspect shooter n n police officer respond heroic immediate action mayor say n nlt col mike john say unclear suspect among nine wound encourage anyone information happen report police n nwhat happen late rhine shoot n nthe corner main street woodward heart rhine entertainment district dozen bar restaurant clubs area thousand people come neighborhood every weekend n npolice say officer assign civil disturbance response team come corner disperse large crowd officer scene shot ring john say surveillance video show physical altercation crowd suspect fire n ncincinnati otr shoot security camera footage show people run sound gunshot n ncincinnati police officer joseph shake fired one round one shooting suspect flee john say suspect flee toward zeigler park shot hear come south main street leading police believe least two people fire n nsecurity camera footage show people run sound gunshot otr mass shoot security camera near corner th main street capture footage early sunday morning cincinnati enquirer n nshook join police department john say n n act immediately john say ran toward gunfire n njohn say action action first responder save life n nin immediate aftermath shoot large crowd remain police struggle make way medic john say n nsome officer use bang ball loud explosive roll ground move crowd back quickly john say officer find people shot start render first aid recent year officer carry tourniquet situation like john say several used officer main street n ncincinnati councilman call accountability n ncincinnati city councilman scotty johnson former police officer speak press sunday n nhe say small number people can not seem solve problem dispute without reach gun johnson say people business owner rhine deserve become victim due individual ridiculous beef n nsupport local journalism subscribe enquirer today access content online http cm cincinnati com specialoffer n n want everyone come downtown good time say make unsafe everyone go get away n nhe call personal accountability say people need find good way settle argument anyone know anything happen come forward police information n n well city johnson say n nwhat next cincinnati police late shoot n nthe police department see thing change main street already take action john say n njohn say patrols area increase past month due large crowd form main street say staffing issue city generous budget overtime n npureval say city keep explore option expand conflict resolution program already fund new police recruit class n nthe mayor say gun violence city center around drug trafficking big shift past n nrecently high profile shooting like kill park lot oakley target shoot smale park july shoot grant park year stem personal dispute accord police n n gun violence inappropriate pureval say people solve difference without reach gun n nhe say prevalence gun community contribute problem say good mental health resource conflict resolution training need n n need people call police disagreement say n npureval say cincinnati alone devasting trend n n across country say n notr business owner none u sleep n nthe shoot great cincinnati fourth mass shoot n nthe fbi defines mass shoot shoot four victim n nthe shoot near main th street casualty shoot city since cameo nightclub shoot incident two people die people injure east end club n nthere people shoot rhine far year survive double shoot june block sunday shoot triple shoot block vine street earlier month n nlindsey swadner own hub th main street say employee neighbor traumatize n n witness non stop shooting swadner say none u sleep n nshe say even gun pull ask someone leave property n nshe say bartender employee rhine need counsel mental health support thing witness swadner praise city council responsive listen acknowledged police respond crime necessarily prevent n n end try make sure bartender sob hysterically freak whether safe go home swadner say n n know open say put bartender position saw mass shoot kind horrible,0.5115226350733821,1

The injured are; Rusizi Rwamayanje and Ronald Nihabusa.\n\nThe incident occurred on saturday night at around 9:30PM  at Mushunga in Burera district.\n\nThe LC1 chairman for Muguri B village in Ryakarimira town council Robert Bamuturaki said that both the deceased and injured together with a group of other Rwandan nationals had crossed back to Rwanda through a porous border of Muguri B before they were intercepted by Rwandan security officials in Mushunga a few meters away from the border.\n\nBamuturaki said that the victims had spent the whole evening having a social hour in Muguri trading centre  Ryakarimira town council and later crossed with bags of local waragi.\n\nHe says that in the process  when soldiers started shooting the victims ran back to Uganda but Chabobuzi was shot on the chest and buttocks while Rusizi was shot on the shoulder while Nihabusa was shot on the leg.\n\nHe says that Chabobuzi died at Ryakarimira trading centre while being rushed by his colleagues to Muguri health centre II for treatment.

"Gay bar shooting suspect faces murder, hate crime charges",https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/patrons-gay-club-shooting-hit-053537524.html?src=rss,"['COLORADO SPRINGS  Colo. (AP) — The man suspected of opening fire at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs was being held on murder and hate crime charges Monday  while hundreds of people gathered to honor the five people killed and 17 wounded in the attack on a venue that for decades was a sanctuary for the local LGBTQ community.\n\nAnderson Lee Aldrich  22  faces five murder charges and five charges of committing a bias-motivated crime causing bodily injury in Saturday night\'s attack at Club Q  online court records showed.\n\nAuthorities said the attack was halted by two club patrons including Richard Fierro  who told reporters Monday night that he took a handgun from Aldrich  hit him with it and pinned him down with help from another person.\n\nFierro  a 15-year U.S. Army veteran who owns a local brewery  said he was celebrating a birthday with family members when the suspect “came in shooting.” Fierro said during a lull in the shooting he ran at the suspect  who was wearing some type of armor plates  and pulled him down before severely beating him until police arrived.\n\n“I tried to save people and it didn’t work for five of them ” he said. “These are all good people. ... I’m not a hero. I’m just some dude.”\n\nFierro’s daughter\'s longtime boyfriend  Raymond Green Vance  22  was killed  while his daughter hurt her knee as she ran for cover. Fierro injured his hands  knees and ankle while stopping the shooter.\n\nThe suspect remained hospitalized with unspecified injuries but is expected to make his first court appearance in the next couple of days  after doctors clear him to be released from the hospital.\n\nThe charges against Aldrich were preliminary  and prosecutors had not filed formal charges in court yet. The hate crime charges would require proving that the gunman was motivated by bias  such as against the victims’ actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nLocal and federal authorities during a Monday news briefing declined to answer questions about why hate crime charges are being considered  citing the ongoing investigation. District Attorney Michael Allen noted that the murder charges would carry the harshest penalty — life in prison — whereas bias crimes are eligible for probation.\n\nStory continues\n\n“But it is important to let the community know that we do not tolerate bias motivated crimes in this community  that we support communities that have been maligned  harassed and intimidated and abused "" Allen said. “And that’s one way that we can do that  showing that we will put the money where our mouth is  essentially  and make sure that we try it that way.”\n\nAdditional charges are possible as the investigation continues  he said.\n\nAbout 200 people gathered Monday night in the cold at a city park for a community vigil for the shooting victims. People held candles  embraced and listened as speakers on a stage expressed both rage and sadness over the shootings.\n\nJeremiah Harris  who is 24 and gay  said he went to Club Q a couple times a month and recognized one of the victims as the bartender who always served him. He said hearing others speak at the vigil was galvanizing following the attack at what for more than 20 years had been considered an LGBTQ safe spot in the conservative-leaning city.\n\n“Gay people have been here as long as people have been here ” Harris said. “To everybody else that\'s opposed to that ... we\'re not going anywhere. We\'re just getting louder and you have to deal with it.”\n\nThe other victims were identified by authorities and family members as Ashley Paugh  35  a mother who helped find homes for foster children; Daniel Aston  28  who had worked at the club as a a bartender and entertainer; Kelly Loving  40  whose sister described her as “caring and sweet""; and Derrick Rump  38  another club bartender who was known for his quick wit and adopting his friends as his family.\n\nVance’s family said in a statement that the Colorado Springs native was adored by his family and had recently gotten a job at FedEx  where he hoped to save enough money to get his own apartment.\n\nThomas James was identified by authorities as the other patron who intervened to stop the shooter. Fierro said a third person also helped — a performer at the club who Fierro said kicked the suspect in the head as she ran by.\n\nCourt documents laying out Aldrich’s arrest have been sealed at the request of prosecutors. Information on whether Aldrich had a lawyer was not immediately available.\n\nA law enforcement official said the suspect used an AR-15-style semi-automatic weapon. A handgun and additional ammunition magazines also were recovered. The official could not discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThirteen victims remained hospitalized Monday  officials said. Five people had been treated and released.\n\nOfficials on Monday clarified that 18 people were hurt in the attack  not 25 as they said originally. Among them was one person whose injury was not a gunshot wound. Another victim had no visible injuries  they said.\n\nColorado Springs  a city of about 480 000  is 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Denver. Mayor John Suthers said there was “reason to hope” all of the hospitalized victims would recover.\n\nThe assault quickly raisedquestions about why authorities did not seek to take Aldrich’s guns away from him in 2021  when he was arrested after his mother reported he threatened her with a homemade bomb and other weapons.\n\nThough authorities at the time said no explosives were found  gun-control advocates have asked why police didn’t use Colorado’s “red flag” laws to seize the weapons his mother says he had. There’s no public record prosecutors ever moved forward with felony kidnapping and menacing charges against Aldrich.\n\nIt was the sixth mass killing this month  and it came in a year when the nation was shaken by the deaths of 21 in a school shooting in Uvalde  Texas. It also rekindled memories of the 2016 massacre at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando  Florida  that killed 49 people.\n\nPresident Joe Biden talked to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis by phone and will continue to press Congress for an assault weapons ban “because thoughts and prayers are just not enough ” White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday.\n\nA makeshift memorial that sprang up in the hours after the attack continued to grow Monday  as a stream of mourners brought flowers and left messages in support of the LGBTQ community. The shooting site remained cordoned off.\n\n“It’s a reminder that love and acceptance still have a long way to go ” Colorado Springs resident Mary Nikkel said at the site.\n\nSince 2006  there have been 523 mass killings and 2 727 deaths as of Nov. 19  according to The Associated Press/USA Today database on mass killings in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nBedayn is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Did two Belgian nationals fall victim to Rwandan death squads? - MO,https://www.mo.be/en/analysis/two-belgians-victims-rwandan-death-squads,['Rwandese death squads might be active in Belgium BKL ART (CC BY-NC 2.0)\u200b\n\nTwo citizens of Bruges died in South-Africa under suspicious circumstances. The family of the first victim  Thomas Ngeze  points the finger at the Rwandan State. The family of Pieter-Jan Staelens  the second victim  has doubts about Rwanda’s part in the two deaths. To anyone who has ever been into contact with Rwandan secret services  this double tragedy brings up bad memories.\n\nIn June 2018 Thomas Ngeze was found dead in a Johannesburg hotel room. He was the son of Hassan Ngeze  a Rwandan journalist sentenced for complicity in Rwandan genocide . Father Ngeze is currently serving his sentence in a UN prison in Mali. He recently applied for early release. According to his family  the Rwandan government is sending him a clear message  with Thomas’ death.\n\nOn the request of the Ngeze family  Pieter-Jan Staelens was following up the investigation of Thomas’ death. At the end of July Pieter-Jan himself dies in a car fire. According to Ngeze’s family there is a direct connection between the two deaths and involvement of Rwandan death squads cannot be ruled out.\n\nSouth-Africa is a country where Rwandan spies have been suspected of actively assaulting their enemies. In Belgium as well  secret services were forced to protect individuals from ‘serious threats from the Rwandan embassy’. State security cannot officially confirm that Rwandan death squads have been active on Belgian soil. Witnesses and experts however suspect they have been.\n\nSouth-Africa is known territory for Rwandan death squads\n\nIn the local newspaper Krant van West-Vlaanderen  the family of Thomas Ngeze’s states that Thomas had an appointment with people from the Rwandan embassy just before his death. Camera images of the hotel registered how he was accompanied from the lobby to the hotel room where he was found dead later.\n\nThomas’ death is reminiscent of the death of Patrick Karegeya. On New Year’s Eve 2013 mister Karegeya was found lifeless in a Johannesburg hotel room. His last encounter was recorded on camera as well. The former chief of Rwandan secret services had already been under political protection in South- Africa for several years and had already survived two attempts on his life. That night however  the hotel meeting ended dramatically.\n\nThe investigation on the death of Patrick Karegeya never delivered any results  but two months later an attempt on yet another Rwandan dissident  general Faustin Nyamwasa  failed  once again the attempt took place on South-African soil. South-Africa evicted three Rwandan diplomats following the incident. Diplomatic relations between both countries have dropped to a low point.\n\nA few months later two Canadian journalists  Geoffrey York and Judi Rever  removed all doubts. In a thorough piece in The Globe and Mail  they shared secret recordings of a man who was given the assignment to assassinate both Patrick Karegeya and Faustin Nyamwase. In exchange for successfully executing the mission  Robert Higiro  former major in the Rwandan army  was promised one million dollars and shares in a telecom company.\n\nFearing for his own life  Higiro did not dare to refuse immediately. He decided to play along  but taped the conversations. When negotiations slowed down  due to issues with advance payments  Higiro decided to flee the country and applied for political asylum in Belgium. After the murder on Karegeya and the failed attempt on the life of Nyamwesa  Higiro shared his story with York and Rever.\n\nRwandan secret services feel at home in Belgium\n\nHigiro’s audio-recordings and the research of York and Rever confirm the suspicions that the Rwandan government deploys death squads in order to silence opponents of the country . Suspicious deaths were reported not only in South-Africa  but in Uganda and Kenya as well  All of these incidents were attributed to the activities of Rwandan death squads. In Europe several attempts were foiled as well.\n\nIn the United Kingdom secret services offered protection to Rwandan critics after they had established a serious threat from the Rwandan embassy. This year British security services are reported to have provided protection for Noble Marara  former bodyguard of president Kagame and author of the book Behind the Presidential Curtains.\n\nGuy Rapaille  withdrawing president of Committee I  the committee of supervision on the intelligence and security services   stated in an interview with the magazine Knack earlier this year  that the presence of Rwandan death squads in Europe is not to be ruled out. He was not able to make any claims about their involvement in Belgium.\n\nCanadian journalist Judi Rever does not question the fact that Rwandan death squads could strike on Belgian soil. She appeared to have become a target of Rwandan security services during a work visit to Belgium in 2014. Rever was working on the preparations of her book In Praise of Blood  which will appear in Dutch in October at Amsterdam University Press. The book describes the crimes of president Kagame’s former rebel forces during and after Rwandan genocide on the Tutsi in the spring of 1994.\n\n‘The threats came from the Rwandan embassy’\n\nWhen Rever arrived in the hotel in Brussels in 2014  she was awaited by Belgian state security. ‘There had been reliable information that indicated that my safety was at stake. I was informed that the threat came from the Rwandan embassy.’ During her stay in Belgium Rever was put under protection around the clock.\n\nIt is not common for foreign journalists to be granted this level of protection in Belgium. ‘My protection must have cost the Belgian state a fortune ’ Rever stated  ‘I had received some threatening messages  but I mostly thought they were just trying to scare me. That day I realized that I was in real danger.’\n\n‘I trust Belgian state security  but Belgian politicians not so much’\n\nAlthough the experience left a deep impression on Judi Rever  her book still appeared. ‘Whoever writes about Rwanda  soon becomes part of the story. I had to complete this mission. But I do have to confess that ever since I think twice before writing a story on Rwanda  asking myself if it is really worth it to place myself in such a vulnerable position.’\n\n‘Given their experience  Belgium and South-Africa will seriously consider the Rwandan track’\n\n‘I personally have too little information to express an opinion on the deaths of the two Belgians in South-Africa. But I do follow the case’  Rever confirms. ‘Belgium and South-Africa are both countries that have experience with the Rwandan secret services. I assume they have an eye for possible leads that could lead to Rwanda.’\n\nRever believes that the two countries  given their experience  will at least take the Rwandan track seriously. She also compliments the professional approach of the Belgian security service.\n\nJean Marie Micombero  a Rwandan dissident whose safety has been in danger in Belgium  shares the same confidence. Once he was the Secretary-General of the Rwandan ministry of Defense and a member of the country’s court-martial. Since 2011 he has been granted protection as a political refugee.\n\n‘Belgian politicians do not seem aware of the clandestine activities of the country on Belgian soil. Rwanda takes advantage of this.’\n\n‘I do not think the Belgian security services underestimate Rwanda. The real danger is Belgian politicians underestimating Rwanda. They do not seem aware of the clandestine activities of the country on Belgian soil. Rwanda takes advantage of this.’\n\nHe feels safe in Belgium however  ‘because in Belgium there is knowledge and experience about Rwanda which you cannot find easily in other countries. But there must also be a political will to curtail certain activities and impose sanctions if things get out of hand.’ Micombero has less confidence in his new homeland on this level.\n\nSpreading fear and doubt is a weapon\n\nRwanda’s secret services  and perhaps also its death squads  may be active in South Africa and Belgium. Whether Rwanda would really go as far as to kill two Belgian men on South African soil  just to rely a message to a man who has already been convicted  is a different question.\n\n‘Suspicion alone frightens many people’\n\nJudi Rever thinks that Rwanda is most dangerous when incriminating information about the state threatens to surface. ‘But you cannot exclude anything. Suspicion alone frightens many people.’\n\nThe psychological effect of these two cases on Rwanda’s critical voices and dissidents has in fact already become reality. Presumptions of espionage also put pressure on mutual trust within the Rwandan diaspora in Belgium.\n\nJean Marie Micombero confirms that the spread of fear is an important weapon of the Rwandan secret services. ‘Someone who does not know Rwanda that well might say that we are all somewhat paranoid. But I know the system all too well. You have to consider every possibility.’\n\n‘Daily Rwanda recruits people in Belgium to spy within the diaspora.’ For that reason  Micombero built some safety mechanisms in his daily routine. But he continues to maintain contacts within the Rwandan community. ‘I want to stay informed about what is happening in my country. Unlike others I will not isolate myself  but I am always on my guard.’\n\nBelgian youngsters from the Rwandan diaspora are set up against each other\n\n‘Rwanda Daily recruits people in Belgium to spy within the diaspora’ Rwanda Government (CC BY-ND 2.0)\u200b\n\nMicombero is strategic and careful in his contacts within the Rwandan diaspora in Belgium. He advises Belgian young people of Rwandan descent who want to strengthen ties with the country of origin  to be more cautious. According to him this group is a particular target for recruitment. ‘Rwanda organizes camps for youngsters from the diaspora. These are campaigns that serve to stir up patriotic feelings and then recruit gullible youngsters for their own foreign agenda’  warns Micombero.\n\nNatacha Abingeneye  one of the driving forces behind Jambo VZW  an association for human rights that unites young people from the diaspora of the Great Lakes region  recognizes the story. ‘I see a lot of Belgian young people leave for Rwanda. Sometimes to enter such a camp. Sometimes it goes a step further and a youngster is promised a nice career in the country of origin.’\n\nBut according to Natacha  such a professional offer is rarely unconditional  which only becomes clear much later. ‘A young Belgian was offered a nice job at the Rwandan ministry. But after a promising start the threats and intimidations followed. Afterwards he turned out not to have met certain expectations. They thought he was close with a person in Belgium  who held the interest of the Rwandan secret services. When the connection did not seem that strong after all he did not turn out to be a useful pawn and he got into trouble. I can give you more examples like this.’\n\n‘That Belgian youngsters are being used weighs on the relationships within the community’\n\n‘The fact that Belgian youngsters are being used in Rwanda’s foreign strategy weighs on the relationships within the community’  says Natacha. ‘We grow up together in Belgium and initially we do not even know who is Hutu and who is Tutsi. We go to the same schools and meet each other at the same parties.’ But when Natacha and her friends try to diversify Jambo  where the members mainly have a Hutu background  the unity quickly disintegrates.\n\n‘Young people with a Tutsi background are suddenly warned about the fact that we are children of genocidaires and therefore dangerous.’ According to Natacha  it goes so far that friends preventively broke contact with her before traveling to Rwanda. Friendships on Facebook are increasingly being broken after intimidations and insinuations.\n\n‘Many young people may initially be somewhat naive about the activities of Rwanda on Belgian soil  but that naivety quickly disappears when you consider the impact on real bonds and friendships’  says Natacha.\n\nA difficult search for truth begins\n\nOn social media Natacha often receives threats due to her activities at Jambo. ‘At a certain point I was so frightened it affected my health. I started to shut myself in  was constantly looking over my shoulder. My career and private life suffered severely. Moving has brought me a lot of peace.’\n\nThe concerns of the family of Thomas Ngeze are personally dear to Natacha. Her father was also suspected of being a part of the Rwandan genocide. In 2005 he participated in an investigation of the Rwandan tribunal. However  he never appeared before the tribunal because his body was discovered in the canal of Brussels that very year.’\n\n‘His disappearance and death were initially considered suspicious. Before his death he left a letter in custody with different people. If something should happen with him the letter should be released.’ The father of Natacha stated in his writing that he was under pressure to make incriminating statements against certain individuals. According to him he had been asked to make false accusations. He wanted to make an official statement before the tribunal  but wished to end cooperation with the researchers.\n\n‘We never got the answers we hoped to get’\n\nIn the end the official cause of death was ‘suicide’. ‘Incredible’  according to his daughter. ‘Maybe it was the Rwandan government  maybe Hutu extremists  maybe there is yet another explanation for his death. But it is not suicide. We never got the answers we hoped to get ’ Natacha says. ‘I empathize with the family of Thoma Ngenze and Pieter-Jan Staelens and hope that they will receive the answers I never got.’\n\nMeanwhile the Belgian Prosecutor is following the South-African investigation into the passing of the two residents of Bruges. Both in Belgium and in South Africa  the two deaths are currently regarded as two separate files. The public prosecutor’s office is also preparing an application to conduct its own judicial investigation in South Africa.\n\nThis piece was translated from Dutch by Elise Vandepoele and Pable Elisa

The other two in the car  including Franca’s best friend Francesco Fontana  48  escaped with injuries.\n\nFranca was in the car with her best friend of 20 years  Francesco Fontana (Picture: Central News)\n\nAt the time  Boochoon was not allowed to be on the road because of a previous conviction for driving while intoxicated. He also had no insurance.\n\nFranca’s husband James Manns read his victim impact statement out to the court.\n\nHe said: ‘The killing of my wife  and the mother of our two young daughters  has devastated us.\n\n‘We still can’t and I doubt we will come to terms with this tragedy.\n\n‘Every day I feel sick in the pit of my stomach and I will never get over the image in my head of when I was with Franca the day she died in hospital.

The truth is that it is real and nothing could be done or said to change it or make it better.\n\n‘It’s not possible to put into words the impact the dangerous driving of Steve Boochoon has had on my life.\n\n‘It has been beautiful to have you in my life for 20 years.\n\n‘I don’t understand why dangerous people are left on our streets while you won’t be here to see your girls growing up.’\n\nSpeaking directly to Boochoon  judge Mark Dennis said: ‘This was a dreadful tragedy which in a moment has blighted the lives of so many.\n\n‘You acted in disregard to your driving ban and the driving laws and you displayed a total disregard for the safety of other road users.\n\n‘Sadly  Franca Grossi has paid the ultimate price for your recklessness.’\n\nBoochoon  from Hornsey  admitted causing death by dangerous driving  causing death by driving while disqualified  causing death by driving while uninsured and using a motor vehicle in a public place with no insurance.\n\nHe was sentenced to eight years in jail and will be banned from driving for 10 years and five months.\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this  check our news page.'],franca grossi leave behind two teenage daughter devastate husband picture central news n na drink driver say think accident kill mum two injured two others funny n nsteve boochoon show compassion concern others crash uber carry year old mum franca grossi midnight august n nwhen police ask think destroyed car boochoon answer honest problem n nhe laugh tell officer ive two shot bro n nthe accident happen residential street haringey north london boochoon wrong side road travel almost three time mph speed limit n nhe crash francas taxi fast driver say even realise car old bailey heard n nfranca way home work drink die injury next day two car include francas best friend francesco fontana escape injury n nfranca car best friend year francesco fontana picture central news n nat time boochoon allow road previous conviction driving intoxicate also insurance n nfrancas husband james manns read victim impact statement court n nhe say kill wife mother two young daughter devastate u n nwe still cant doubt come term tragedy n nevery day feel sick pit stomach never get image head franca day die hospital piece also die day n nit also devastate mother four sister niece come term fact wrongfully take away u soon n nshe young kind generous passionate happy woman always laugh help people sincere honesty love n nthe loss franca impact death bring huge financial stress two daughter worry pay rent bill food daily concern n nim leave anger hatred towards steve boochoon never felt towards anyone life n ni never forgive forget do n nlooking boochoon dock say destroyed life never n nhe add eldest daughter traumatise give impact statement n nfrancesco best friend franca year similarly heartbroken n nshe say dear franca ive try write life without last nine week n ni didnt want write talk make real truth real nothing could do say change make good n nit possible put word impact dangerous drive steve boochoon life n nit beautiful life year n ni dont understand dangerous people leave street wont see girl grow n nspeaking directly boochoon judge mark dennis say dreadful tragedy moment blight life many n nyou act disregard drive ban drive law display total disregard safety road user n nsadly franca grossi pay ultimate price recklessness n nboochoon hornsey admit cause death dangerous drive cause death driving disqualify cause death driving uninsured use motor vehicle public place insurance n nhe sentence eight year jail ban drive year five month n nget touch news team email u webnews metro co uk n nfor story like check news page,0.5887436723603968,1

German police investigate deadly train attack - DW - 07/18/2016,https://www.dw.com/en/several-injured-in-attack-on-train-near-w%C3%BCrzburg-southern-germany/a-19408848,"['Bavarian authorities are piecing together the movements of a 17-year-old Afghan refugee who stabbed commuters in Würzburg. A video circulated by IS purports to show the perpetrator  who was shot dead by police.\n\nThree people were seriously injured on Monday night after a 17-year-old Afghan refugee went on a stabbing rampage with a knife and an axe near the southern German city of Würzburg  some 280 kilometers (174 miles) north-west of Munich. The suspect was shot dead by police shortly after.\n\nThe incident occurred on Monday at around 9:15 p.m. local time (1915 UTC) on a regional commuter train traveling between the German towns of Treuchtlingen and Würzburg. Fourteen passengers were also treated for shock  while one other person sustained light injuries.\n\nAx attack on German train To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n""Islamic State"" (IS) flag found\n\nSpeaking on German television Tuesday  Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said investigators were making contact with people involved with the 17-year-old. He had been living in Würzburg since March  in a home for minors who had travelled to Germany unaccompanied to seek asylum. The foster family home where he had lived for the past two weeks was searched.\n\n""A hand-painted IS flag was found in his room "" Herrmann said.\n\n""Islamic State"" (IS) posted a video on Tuesday featuring an individual that the militant group identified as the perpetrator of the attack. In the clip the teenager is seen with a knife  saying he will use it to kill infidels.\n\nAamaq  a news agency linked to IS  said the group claimed responsibility for the attack and that the 17-year-old was its ""fighter."" The claim was phrased in a similar way to the IS response to the Bastille Day truck attack which killed 84 people in Nice  France last week.\n\nHerrmann had earlier said investigators were following every lead to determine the teenager\'s motive and it was too early to say whether he had an Islamist background. So far  it was understood that he had acted alone.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa/K. J. Hildenbrand\n\nHerrmann confirmed in an earlier television interview that the teenager boarded the train in Ochsenfurt  where he had been staying with a foster family.\n\n""He suddenly attacked passengers with a knife and an axe  critically injuring several. Some of them may now be fighting for their lives.""\n\nThe Afghan national reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar "" Arabic for ""God is great "" before launching the attack  wielding a knife and axe.\n\n""The perpetrator was able to leave the train  police left in pursuit and as part of this pursuit  they shot the attacker and killed him "" a police spokesman said. On Tuesday  Herrmann added that a police special unit happened to be in the area and was able to respond to the incident quickly.\n\nVictims from Hong Kong\n\nOn Tuesday  Herrmann also told ZDF public television that two victims were in a critical condition. The four injured victims were a family from Hong Kong. Hong Kong\'s top official  Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying  issued a statement condemning the attack and said representatives from the Hong Kong office in Berlin were visiting the victims in hospital. The ""South China Morning Post"" newspaper reported that the family included a father  mother  daughter and the daughter\'s boyfriend. Another family member  a son aged 17  was not hurt  the newspaper reported.\n\n\'We cannot guarantee 100 percent safety\'\n\nIn light of the recent mass-casualty terror attacks in neighboring France and Belgium  German society is on heightened alert. Herrmann on Tuesday said police needed to be strengthened but it was clear that authorities could never guarantee 100 percent safety for citizens.\n\n""There cannot be a police officer in every train "" he said  adding that even though a lone attacker with a knife or axe could theoretically strike anywhere in Germany  the challenge for authorities was to do everything where possible to track people with bad intentions before they got out of control.']",bavarian authority piece together movement year old afghan refugee stab commuter würzburg video circulate purport show perpetrator shot dead police n nthree people seriously injure monday night year old afghan refugee go stab rampage knife axe near southern german city würzburg kilometer mile north west munich suspect shot dead police shortly n nthe incident occur monday around p local time utc regional commuter train traveling german town treuchtlingen würzburg fourteen passenger also treat shock one person sustain light injury n nax attack german train view video please enable javascript consider upgrading web browser support html video n n islamic state flag find n nspeaking german television tuesday bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann say investigator make contact people involve year old living würzburg since march home minor travel germany unaccompanied seek asylum foster family home live past two week search n n hand paint flag find room herrmann say n n islamic state post video tuesday feature individual militant group identify perpetrator attack clip teenager see knife say use kill infidel n naamaq news agency link say group claim responsibility attack year old fighter claim phrase similar way response bastille day truck attack kill people nice france last week n nherrmann early say investigator follow every lead determine teenager motive early say whether islamist background far understood act alone n nimage picture alliance dpa k j hildenbrand n nherrmann confirm early television interview teenager board train ochsenfurt stay foster family n n suddenly attacked passenger knife axe critically injure several may fight life n nthe afghan national reportedly shout allahu akbar arabic god great launching attack wield knife axe n n perpetrator able leave train police leave pursuit part pursuit shot attacker kill police spokesman say tuesday herrmann add police special unit happen area able respond incident quickly n nvictims hong kong n non tuesday herrmann also tell zdf public television two victim critical condition four injured victim family hong kong hong kong top official chief executive leung chun ying issue statement condemn attack say representative hong kong office berlin visit victim hospital south china morning post newspaper report family include father mother daughter daughter boyfriend another family member son age hurt newspaper report n n can not guarantee percent safety n nin light recent mass casualty terror attack neighbor france belgium german society heighten alert herrmann tuesday say police need strengthen clear authority could never guarantee percent safety citizen n n can not police officer every train say add even though lone attacker knife axe could theoretically strike anywhere germany challenge authority everything possible track people bad intention get control,0.548323438416757,1

Istanbul explosion: Suspect in custody in Istiklal Street blast that killed...,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/13/europe/istanbul-turkey-explosion-intl/index.html,['Istanbul CNN —\n\nA suspect is in custody related to an explosion that killed at least six people and injured at least 81 others in Istanbul on Sunday  Turkey’s interior ministry said early Monday.\n\nThe incident has been deemed a terrorist attack  Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Sunday  according to state news agency Anadolu.\n\n“We consider it to be a terrorist act as a result of an attacker  whom we consider to be a woman  detonating the bomb ” Oktay told reporters Sunday.\n\nTurkish officials believe Kurdish separatists from the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) were most likely behind the deadly suspected bomb attack  the country’s interior minister  Suleyman Soylu  told reporters Monday.\n\n“It is PKK/PYD terrorist organization according to our preliminary findings ” Soylu said in a press conference at the scene of Sunday’s attack on Istiklal Avenue  Istanbul.\n\nSoylu did not elaborate or provide details of how investigators had reached this conclusion.\n\n“A little while ago the person who left the bomb (was) taken under custody by teams of Istanbul Police Department. Before their arrest 21 more people were also taken under custody ” the minister said. “The face of terrorism is bitter  but we will continue this struggle to the end  whatever the cost is.”\n\nCCTV footage shows a woman sitting on a bench for more than 40 minutes and then getting up one or two minutes before the explosion  leaving a bag or plastic bag behind  according to Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag.\n\nBozdag  who made the comments in an interview with privately owned A Haber news channel  said Turkish security forces believe the woman is the suspect  and officials are investigating her.\n\n“There are two possibilities. Either that bag or plastic bag has a mechanism in it  it explodes on its own or someone detonates it from afar. All of these are currently under investigation.” he added.\n\n“The name of the woman is unknown ” he said. “All the recordings and data about the woman are being analyzed.”\n\nAmbulances and police respond to the scene in a bustling part of Istanbul. Kemal Aslan/Reuters\n\nThe blast happened on Istiklal Street in Beyoglu Square  in the heart of Turkey’s largest city  Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya said.\n\n“We wish God’s mercy on those who lost their lives and a speedy recovery to the injured ” Yerlikaya tweeted.\n\nPeople hug at the scene of the explosion. Cem Tekkesinoglu/di images/Getty Images\n\nThe six people killed include Yusuf Meydan  a member of Turkey’s Ministry of Family and Social Services  and his daughter Ecrin  according to Derya Yanık  the minister of the agency.\n\nSoylu  the interior minister  said Monday that 50 of the 81 people injured have been discharged from the hospital  with 31 people still being treated.\n\nTurkey’s conflict with Kurdish separatist groups has spanned four decades and claimed tens of thousands of lives. The PKK has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey  the United States and the European Union.\n\n“In particular  the insincerity of our so-called allies who seem friendly to us  who either hide terrorists in their own country  or feeds terrorists in the areas they occupy and send them money from their own senates  is obvious ” Soylu said.\n\n“We will give them a response in the near future  to those who caused us this pain in Beyoglu Istiklal Street so they experience more and more pain ” Soylu said.\n\n‘What looked like the aftermath of a war zone’\n\nWitness Tariq Keblaoui said he was shopping on Istiklal Street when the explosion happened about 10 meters (32.8 feet) ahead of him.\n\n“People were scattering immediately ” said Keblaoui  a Lebanese-based journalist who was on his last day of vacation in the city.\n\nTurkish police and explosives experts work the scene of the explosion Sunday. Hitham Dahman/CNN\n\n“Very shortly after  I could see how many injured were on the ground ” Keblaoui told CNN. He says he saw dead bodies and victims who were seriously injured.\n\n“There was a man in the store bleeding from his ears and his legs  and his friends were crying near him ” Keblaoui said.\n\nPolice officers secure the area after the explosion. Burak Kara/Getty Images\n\nIstiklal Street was packed with visitors when the blast happened Sunday afternoon  he said.\n\n“It went very quickly from a very peaceful Sunday with a very crowded street full of tourists to being what looked like the aftermath of a war zone ” Keblaoui said.\n\nCountries unite in condemning the attack\n\nNews of the explosion led to a torrent of condolences from around the world.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron  whose own country suffered a deadly terror attack exactly seven years earlier  shared his sympathies for the Turkish people.\n\n“On this day so symbolic for our Nation  while we think of the victims who fell on November 13  2015  the Turkish people are struck by an attack in their heart  Istanbul ” Macron tweeted Sunday. “To the Turks: we share your pain.

Salman Rushdie is injured after being stabbed on stage,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11106479/Salman-Rushdie-injured-stabbed-ahead-speech-New-York.html,"[""Advertisement\n\nNew York State Police have identified the suspect in Friday's stabbing of novelist Salman Rushdie as a New Jersey man who  according to law enforcement sources  allegedly had 'sympathies toward the Iranian government.'\n\nRushdie  75  whose novel 'The Satanic Verses' drew death threats from Iran's leader in the 1980s  remained in surgery Friday evening hours after being stabbed up to 15 times by a man who rushed the stage as the author was about to give a lecture in western New York.\n\nAuthorities confirmed that the attacker Hadi Matar  24  of Fairview  New Jersey  was arrested at the scene and was awaiting arraignment. State police Maj. Eugene Staniszewski said the motive for the stabbing was unclear.\n\nBut law enforcement sources told The New York Post that an initial investigation suggests Matar is sympathetic to the Iranian regime and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard.\n\nRushdie  who has been the subject of death threats from the Iranian regime since the late 1980s  was attacked as he was being introduced to the stage for the CHQ 2022 event in Chautauqua  near Buffalo  on Friday morning.\n\nWitnesses claim that Rushdie was stabbed 10 to 15 times  as Matar approached him from behind before rushing the stage. He is understood to have gained access to the grounds with a pass  police said.\n\nMatar then managed to walk off the stage after the stabbing  before being restrained  as people rushed to assist Rushdie - who had been seated when he was assaulted. A doctor in the crowd helped administer CPR  before he was airlifted to hospital. He remained in surgery on Friday evening in Erie  Pennsylvania.\n\nEvent moderator Henry Reese  73  a co-founder of an organization that offers residencies to writers facing persecution  was also attacked. Reese suffered a facial injury and was treated and released from a hospital  police said. He and Rushdie were due to discuss the United States as a refuge for writers and other artists in exile.\n\nRushdie's novel was viewed as blasphemous by many Muslims in the 1980s  and at least 45 people were killed in riots over the book  leading to it being banned in Iran  where the late leader Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a 1989 fatwa  calling for Rushdie's death.\n\nThe death threats and bounty led Rushdie to go into hiding under a British government protection program  until he emerged after nine years of seclusion and cautiously resumed more public appearances  maintaining his outspoken criticism of religious extremism overall. He has been in the United States since 2000.\n\nSalman Rushdie  75  was attacked by a Hadi Matar  pictured with Sheriff's deputies  who approached him from behind before stabbing him multiple times. The suspect was quickly pinned to the floor before being arrested\n\nState Trooper James O'Callaghan said that the author remained in surgery for his injuries  and that they were unable to give an update on his condition\n\nPeople rushed to assist the author after the attack  with the attacker being restrained by witnesses. The motive for the stabbing is currently unknown\n\nRushdie was airlifted to hospital after receiving medical assistance from those at the event near Buffalo  in Upstate New York\n\nMedics rushed to the scene to take the author to hospital to treat his injuries. A Chautauqua Institution spokesperson  where the event was taking place  said: 'We are dealing with an emergency situation. I can share no further details at this time.'\n\nThe authors suspected attacker was pinned down by witnesses and security staff moments after the attack. Rushdie's son Zafar  42  is aware of the incident\n\nThe attack occurred at the Chautauqua Institution  which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles south of Buffalo.\n\nCarl LeVan  an American University politics professor attending the event  told AFP he saw the suspect run onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and 'stabbed him repeatedly and viciously.'\n\nLeVan  a Chautauqua regular  said the suspect 'was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued ' adding that he believed the man 'was trying to kill' Rushdie.\n\n'There were gasps of horror and panic from the crowd ' the professor said.\n\nLeVan said witnessing the event had left him 'shaken ' adding he considered Chautauqua a safe place of creative freedom.\n\n'To know that this happened here  and to see it -- it was horrific ' he said. 'What I saw today was the essence of intolerance.'\n\nBritish-born Booker Prize winning author Sir Salman Rushdie (pictured in 2019) got death threats and was issued a fatwah by Iran for his 1988 novel  the Satanic Verses. He has lived in the U.S. since 2000 and was today preparing to give a lecture about America being a haven for writers in exile\n\nAnother witness  John Stein  told ABC that the assailant 'started stabbing on the right side of the head  of the neck. And there was blood... erupting.'\n\nBlood was spattered on the wall behind where Rushdie had been attacked  with some also seen on a chair that he had been sitting on.\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul called the attack on Rushdie 'heartbreaking' before confirming that he is 'alive'  during and unrelated press conference.\n\nShe added that he is 'getting the care he needs at a local hospital'  and that a state police trooper 'stood up and saved his life' after the attack.\n\nHochul said that Rushdie had 'spent decades speaking truth to power'.\n\nOne witness told the New York Times that Rushdie had been stabbed 'multiple times' and was lying in a pool of his own blood.\n\nRita Landman offered her assistance after the incident  adding that he appeared to be alive and did not receive CPR.\n\nLandman said: 'People were saying  'He has a pulse  he has a pulse he has a pulse.'\n\nRoger Warner of Cleveland  Ohio  was sitting on the front row when the attack took place  adding: 'He was covered with blood and there was blood running down onto the floor.\n\n'I just saw blood all around his eyes and running down his cheek.'\n\nRushdie's London-based son Zafar  42  is aware of the incident and his father has been seen being transported by air ambulance after the attack.\n\nThousands of people in the audience gasped at the sight of the attack and were then evacuated as his alleged attacker was taken into custody.\n\nJohn Bulette  85  who witnessed the attack said: 'There was a huge security lapse. That somebody could get that close without any intervention was frightening.'\n\nAn usher at the amphitheater claims that the security at the Institution was 'lax' and that no additional measures were in place for Mr Rushdie's visit.\n\nKyle Doershuk  20  said: 'It's very open  it's very accessible  it's a very relaxed environment  in my opinion something like this was just waiting to happen.'\n\nA Chautauqua Institution spokesperson added: 'We are dealing with an emergency situation. I can share no further details at this time.'\n\nRabbi Charles Savenor claims that the entire attack lasted around 20 seconds.\n\nHe said: 'This guy ran on to platform and started pounding on Mr. Rushdie. At first you're like  'What's going on?'\n\nAnd then it became abundantly clear in a few seconds that he was being beaten.'\n\nA representative for the Iranian interests section at the embassy of Pakistan in Washington D.C. declined to comment on the attack.\n\nThe embassy diplomatically represents the government of Iran in the United States.\n\nThey told the New York Times 'we are not getting involved in this'  before hanging up and refusing to give a name.\n\nSenator George Borrello branded the attack as 'shocking' adding that there is 'no room' for 'beliefs that demand that you kill someone who disagrees with you'.\n\nHe added: 'This shocking attack on a celebrated and noted author  apparently prompted by fundamentalist extremism  has no place in America.'\n\nNew York State Police said in a statement: 'On August 12  2022  at about 11 am  a male suspect ran up onto the stage and attacked Rushdie and an interviewer.\n\n'Rushdie suffered an apparent stab wound to the neck and was transported by helicopter to an area hospital.\n\n'His condition is not yet known. The interviewer suffered a minor head injury.\n\n'A State Trooper assigned to the event immediately took the suspect into custody. The Chautauqua County Sheriff's Office assisted at the scene.'\n\nRushdie was attacked on stage ahead of his speech in Chautauqua  near Buffalo  with witnesses claiming that he was 'punched and stabbed'\n\nBlood was spattered on the wall behind where Rushdie had been attacked  with some also seen on a chair. New York State Police confirmed that Rushdie was stabbed in the neck\n\nMedics attended to Rushdie after the attack  with witnesses saying a man 'punched and stabbed' the author as he was announced on stage\n\nBooker Prize winner Salman Rushdie spent years in hiding after being issued 'spiritual' death threat by Iran Sir Salman Rushdie is a Booker Prize-winning author and novelist.

We are all hoping he is okay.'\n\nAuthor Ian McEwan issued a statement about Rushdie  saying: 'This appalling attack on my dear friend Salman represents an assault on freedom of thought and speech.\n\n'These are the freedoms that underpin all our rights and liberties.\n\n'Salman has been an inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world.\n\n'He is a fiery and generous spirit  a man of immense talent and courage  and he will not be deterred.'\n\nThe author was knighted in 2007 in Britain 'for services to literature' by his friend  then Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nHis last piece of writing was about an assassination attempt  serializing a novella called The Seventh Wave on Sub Stack  which appeared to focus on spies and assassinations.\n\nRushdie has previously received death threats for his writing  with his book the Satanic Verses which supposedly insulted the Prophet Mohammed and The Koran.\n\nHe wrote the Satanic Verses  which resulted in a culture war being sparked in 1988 in Britain – with protests taking place in the UK along with book burnings.\n\nPakistan banned the book  and he was issued a fatwa – a death sentence - by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini in February 1989.\n\nKhomeini called for the death of Rushdie and his publishers  and also called for Muslims to point him out to those who could kill him if they could not themselves.\n\nThe fatwa  or 'spiritual opinion'  followed a wave of book burnings in Britain and rioting across the Muslim world which led to the deaths of 60 people and hundreds being injured.\n\nRushdie was put under round-the-clock security from 1989 to 2002  at the expense of the British taxpayer  when a $3million bounty was put on his head.\n\nHe was forced to go into hiding for a decade with police protection  and previously said he received a 'sort of Valentines card' from Iran each year letting him know the country has not forgotten the vow to kill him.\n\nIn 2012  a semi-official Iranian religious foundation raised the bounty for Rushdie from $2.8 million to $3.3 million.\n\nAfter the attack Rushdie  who moved to the US in 2000  was quickly surrounded by a small group of people who held up his legs  presumably to send more blood to his chest.\n\nThe author previously complained about having 'too much' security while attending other events.\n\nHe told reporters a the Prague Writer's Festival: 'To be here and to find a large security operation around me has actually felt a little embarrassing.\n\n'I thought it was really unnecessary and kind of excessive and was certainly not arranged on my request.\n\n'I spent a great deal of time before I came here saying that I really didn't want that.\n\n'So I was very surprised to arrive here and discover a really quite substantial operation  because it felt like being in a time warp  that I had gone back in time several years.'\n\nRushdie is a former president of PEN America  with their current CEO Suzanne Nossel issuing a statement which said: 'PEN America is reeling from shock and horror at word of a brutal  premeditated attack on our former President and stalwart ally  Salman Rushdie  who was reportedly stabbed multiple times while on stage speaking at the Chautauqua Institute in upstate New York.\n\n'We can think of no comparable incident of a public violent attack on a literary writer on American soil.\n\n'Just hours before the attack  on Friday morning Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face.\n\nPolice remain on the scene outside of the Chautauqua Institution after Rushdie was flown to hospital via air ambulance on Friday afternoon\n\nDozens of onlookers quickly rushed to the stage to try to apprehend the suspect  and help Rushdie after he was attacked in front of hundreds\n\nHe was urgently taken to hospital via air ambulance  with his current condition unknown. Rushdie was reportedly stabbed ten to fifteen times  suffering knife wounds in the neck\n\nHis agent  Andrew Wylie  said that the author was currently in surgery for his injuries  but did not have an update on his condition\n\nThe Seventh Wave: Rushdie's last published work focused on spies and assassinations Salman Rushdie was serializing a novella called The Seventh Wave  on Sub Stack  which appeared to have a heavy focus on spies and organized killings. His latest piece of writing referenced men in 'sodden balaclavas': Episode 48 The four men in black wearing sodden balaclavas are out in the open  closing in. ANNA and FRANCIS are on the terrace of the house  holding guns. FIRST MAN (shouting) Come down  Anna  Nobody gonna hurt you. And the other individual we don't require. ANNA (shouting back) Hello  boys! Would you like a refreshing drink? (They come closer.) SECOND MAN (also shouting) Don't you crack wise now  Anna. No  we do not need no fucking drink. Maybe you didn't notice it's wet out. ANNA (still shouting) We have towels. You need to dry your hair? (to FRANCIS) They are within range now. This is too easy. We can take them all. FRANCIS I don't know  Anna. I can't do it.

He has devoted tireless energy to assisting others who are vulnerable and menaced.\n\n'While we do not know the origins or motives of this savage attack  all those around the world who have met words with violence or called for the same are culpable for legitimizing this an assault on a writer while he was engaged in his essential work of connecting to readers.\n\n'Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman  wishing him a full and speedy recovery.\n\n'We hope and believe fervently that his essential voice cannot and will not be silenced.'\n\nHitoshi Igarashi  who translated The Satanic Verses into Japanese for Rushdie  was stabbed to death on the campus where he taught literature.\n\nEttore Capriolo  the Italian translator of the book  was knifed in his apartment in Milan.\n\nThe novel's Norwegian publisher William Nygaard  was shot three times outside his home and left for dead in October 1993  but survived the attack.\n\nIn Turkey  the book's translator  Aziz Nesin  was the target of an arson attack on a hotel that killed 37.\n\nRushdie previously wrote a 655-page fatwa memoir  which was nominated for the UK's top non- fiction award  the Samuel Johnson prize.\n\nDuring the fatwa he lived in permanent terror and at one point thought his ex-wife Clarissa Luard and their son Zafar  who was nine at the time  had been killed by assassins or kidnapped.\n\nIn 1998 Iran's reformist president relaxed the fatwa and said it had no intention of tracking Rushdie down and killing him.\n\nTechnically it still stands but is unlikely to be enforced.\n\nThe Index on Censorship  an organization promoting free expression  said money was raised to boost the reward for his killing as recently as 2016  underscoring that the fatwa for his death still stands.\n\nHe has has two children from his four marriages - his other son is called Milan - but has been linked with many other women including Indian model Riya Sen.\n\nPrince Charles also reportedly refused to support the author during his fatwa because he thought the book was offensive to Muslims.\n\nIn an article for Vanity Fair magazine  Martin Amis claimed that the Prince's views caused a row at a dinner party after Rushdie was issued with the death sentence by Islamic clerics in 1989.\n\nAmis claims that Charles told him that he would not offer support 'if someone insults someone else's deepest convictions'.\n\nAmis remonstrated with him but all Charles did was 'take it on board'  even though Rushdie is a British-Indian citizen.\n\nFellow author Stephen King also refused to let stores in America sell his books if they refused to carry The Satanic Verses.\n\nRushdie has spoken at the Chautauqua Institution before  which is based about 55 miles southwest of Buffalo in a rural corner of New York.\n\nIt is known for its summertime lecture series.\n\nRushdie has been married four times and had a string of high-profile romances that included Padma Lakshmi  Olivia Wide  and models decades younger than him.\n\nHe met his first wife  Clarissa Luard  at a pop concert in the UK in 1969  with the couple marrying in 1976 and having their son Zafar three years later.\n\nAlthough they divorced in 1987  they remained close friends  and Rushdie reportedly stayed by her side when she died from breast cancer at age 50 in 1999.\n\nRushdie has been married four times  including to Elizabeth West Salman  pictured. The couple married in 1994 and two had a son  Milan  in 1999\n\nRushdie attributed his intellect and 'good looks' for his successful love life  which included dates with Oliva Wilde (left). The two were pictured together at the Washington Correspondents Dinner in 2008\n\nSalman Rushdie (right) together with his fourth wife  model and Top Chef host Padma Lakshimi attending the Cannes Film Festival in 2004\n\nBy the time Luard passed  Rushdie had already been married twice. He tied the knot Pulitzer Prize finalist Marianne Wiggins  an American  in 1988 and then to editor Elizabeth West in 1997.\n\nRushdie was with Wiggins when he faced backlash over The Satanic Verses  with Rushdie saying that he heard criticisms that his 'Jewish wife' made him write it.\n\n'At its most unpleasant it was levelled at me from the Islamic side that the Jews made me do it ' Rushdie said. 'They said my [second] wife was Jewish. She wasn't  she was American.'\n\nWiggins spent some time in hiding even after the couple divorced in 1993  and the following year  Rushdie married Elizabeth West  and the two had a son  Milan  in 1999.\n\nRushdie had previously said that he and West  an author and editor  began growing apart when he wanted to move to the US and she wanted to stay in the UK and have another child.\n\nFollowing a miscarriage  the couple officially split in 2004. After the split from West  Rushdie immediately dove into the world of pop celebrities  marrying model turned Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi in 2004.\n\nThe two had met back in 1999 at a lavish New York City party thrown by media queen Tina Brown. Lakshmi alleges that the two had an affair during the party  and that Rushdie promised to be with her once his rocky marriage to West concludes.\n\nRushdie's 2001 novel  Fury  was dedicated to Lakshmi. At the time of the wedding  Lakshmi was 28  while Rushdie was 51.\n\nWhile Rushdie's previous marriages lasted more than a decade  his union with Lakshmi only lasted three years  with the novelist bemoaning her in his memoir as a 'bad investment' who overly narcissistic and ambitious.\n\nLakshmi hit back at Rushdie in her own memoirs  calling him 'sexually needy' and insensitive to her endometriosis.\n\nHow Salman Rushdie lived under the shadow of a fatwa for 30 years: British author went into hiding when Iran's spiritual leader ordered he was killed for 'blasphemous' The Satanic Verses but he was living a 'normal life' in New York before his stabbing\n\nBY JACK WRIGHT\n\nHe was first forced into hiding more than 30 years ago by Iran's theocratic dictatorship after the regime branded The Satanic Verses a work of blasphemy.\n\nFrom ever-changing safe houses  constant armed guards and a new identity  to finally finding a new home in the US  British author Salman Rushdie has now been stabbed in the neck on stage in New York - the supposed beating heart of free speech and culture.\n\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  then Supreme Leader of the Islamic republic  issued a fatwa - or religious ruling - calling on all Muslims to murder the celebrated atheist author and anyone involved in the publication of The Satanic Verses on February 14  1989.\n\nRushdie  now 75  was forced to live under the long shadow the fatwa cast until it was finally lifted by Iran's hardline regime in 1998.\n\nBut for nine years  the writer constantly between safe houses and was protected by round-the-clock armed guards. He even adopted an alias  Joseph Anton - a combination of the first names of two of his favourite writers  Conrad and Chekhov.\n\nThe fatwa also led to the murder of the book's Japanese translator Hitoshi Igarashi  the targeting of its translators and publishers in Turkey  Norway and Italy  and worldwide riots and book-burnings - while The Satanic Verses itself was banned in many countries.\n\nSir Salman Rushdie holding a copy of The Satanic Verses during a 1992 news conference in Arlington\n\nSpeaking about the controversy with the Mail  Sir Salman said: 'Being under the fatwa was a jail  but I think that one of the problems is that from the outside it looked glamorous  as I sometimes showed up in places in Jags with people jumping out to open the door and make sure you get in safely and so on. Looks of who the hell does he think he is? Well  from my side it felt like jail.\n\n'There was this crude argument that I did it in some way for personal advantage  to make myself more famous or to make money. At its most unpleasant it was levelled at me from the Islamic side that the Jews made me do it. They said my [second] wife was Jewish. She wasn't  she was American.\n\n'If I had simply wanted to trade on an insult to Islam I could have done it in a sentence rather than writing a 250 000-word novel  a work of fiction.'\n\nMuslim activists beat a burning effigy of Salman Rushdie in New Delhi\n\n'What you have to remember is that The Satanic Verses is not called Islam the Prophet  it is not called Mohammed  the country is not called Arabia - it all happens in the dream of somebody who is losing their mind.'\n\nWhat still shocks him is that no radical Muslims in Britain who backed the call for his assassination were ever prosecuted.\n\n'There were these occasions  like in Manchester  where Muslim leaders said to their congregation  'Tell me who in this audience would be ready to kill Rushdie?' and everyone in the audience raised their hand. And the police thought this was OK.'\n\nHe says: 'Supposing I had been the Queen and an imam said to his congregation  'Who would be ready to kill the Queen?' and everybody raised their hand. Would you think the police would not act?\n\n'I only use the Queen as an example to dramatize this but it seems odd that when it is a novelist of foreign origin  therefore not completely British in some way  that it was allowed to happen with impunity.'\n\nRushdie remembers his split from his wife Marianne as being a particularly traumatic time. She claimed that the CIA was aware of Rushdie's whereabouts and so his cover was blown. When he realized that she was lying he decided to end the relationship.\n\n'It was very shocking. There simply was a point at which I had to choose whether to be alone in the middle of this hurricane with nobody there for companionship or whether I somehow had to put up with this person in whom it was difficult to have faith.\n\n'It was horrifying to be told by a policeman that they believed that your wife was lying to you. It is an experience most of us don't have. And then for her to say that it was the police who were to be blamed and that I shouldn't trust them sets a kind of mindf*** and I had to make my judgments.\n\n'It became impossible for me to have faith in her veracity. So in the end I thought it was better to separate.'\n\nIn an interview three years ago  he said: 'Islam was not a thing. No one was thinking in that way. One of the things that has happened is that people in the West are more informed than they used to be'.\n\nHe ruefully added: 'I was 41 back then  now I am 71. Things are fine now. We live in a world where the subject changes very fast. And this is a very old subject. There are now many other things to be frightened about - and other people to kill'.""]",advertisement n nnew york state police identify suspect friday stab novelist salman rushdie new jersey man

Serial killers - CAVDEF | Programmed to Kill subjects,http://cavdef.org/w/index.php?title=Serial_killers,"['From CAVDEF\n\nDespite the conventional profile of serial killers as lone nuts driven solely by their own internal demons  there is a compelling case to be made that many of the most prominent serial killers are intelligence assets. Countless serial killers appear to be subjects of mind control programs like those found in Project MKUltra  exhibiting telltale qualities such as early childhood abuse  dissociative disorders  pedophilia  and connections to known or suspected intelligence fronts (like the military  prisons  mental hospitals  and cults). Many of these murders  far from being random killings  are actually targeted assassinations or clean-up operations on behalf of various criminal enterprises (like murder-for-hire  drug trafficking  or sex rings)  which the killers are often associated with. Other murders have no political motive  but fit the profile of Satanic cult killings or a domestic version of the Phoenix Program aimed at terrorizing the public into submission. While this is no doubt a controversial position to take on serial killers  there is often an astounding number of common elements in serial killer cases pointing to some kind of government / intelligence involvement. The ""serial killer"" presented to the public is often a fall-guy taking responsibility for group actions or (on rarer occasions) an entirely innocent patsy.\n\nProgrammed to Kill subjects\n\nBuilding off the research of Mae Brussell  Maury Terry  and Dave Emory  Programmed to Kill by Dave McGowan was the first major work to explore the idea of mind-controlled serial killers. He chronicled some of the most famous serial killers and grouped them into thematic categories. Below is the evidence of official government complicity and/or mind control for the serial killers profiled in McGowan\'s book:\n\nProstitution rings\n\nMarc Dutroux - the head of a Belgian child kidnapping ring with elite clients that was partially exposed in the Dutroux affair\n\nEmile Louis - apparently framed for the murders of women in the French city of Auxerre who were actually killed by a group of high-ranking local men\n\nPatrice Alegre - leader of a drug and prostitution network (that involved minors) with elite clients in the French city of Toulouse\n\nWayne Williams - the designated patsy for the Atlanta child murders  who was involved in the pedophile and Satanic cult operations as a photographer but not the murders  Williams showed tentative signs of being under mind control; a prosecution witness testified under cross examination that he had a ""split personality""; Williams\' journal from 1992 mentioned he received CIA training at age 18 from a paramilitary camp near Atlanta  and an extremely likely suspect for this training would have been Mitch WerBell III\n\nMexican cult killers\n\nCommonalities of serial killer cases Name Abuse and dissociation Pedophilia Government links Satanic/cult links Protection Railroading Parapolitical significance Henry Lee Lucas Claimed he was trained to kill at a paramilitary camp in the Everglades  which happened to be the location of CIA camps for training anti-Castro Cubans that were operating in the same time period as Lucas claimed Worked for the Hand of Death cult Only death row inmate to receive a commutation by Texas governor George W. Bush Ottis Toole Worked for the Hand of Death cult\n\nAccording to Dave McGowan  he visited the Process Church headquarters in New Orleans Rafael Resendez-Ramirez Raised in Matamoros  Mexico by outside his home by non-family members\n\nSaid at trial (""with all the secrecy that’s in the family"") that he was ""instructed"" to do ""anything that can put down Christianity""\n\nArchetypal lone nuts\n\nCommonalities of serial killer cases Name Abuse and dissociation Pedophilia Government links Satanic/cult links Protection Railroading Parapolitical significance David Berkowitz Served in the US Army  during which time he took LSD Affiliated with a splinter group of the Process Church  likely the same ""Four P"" cult involved in the Manson murders Some of the Son of Sam murders (Lauria  Denaro  and Freund) may have been retaliation against people who knew too much about a Nugan Hand-connected drug ring importing heroin through blood supplies Cary Stayner Brother Steven Stayner was kidnapped by a pedophile at age 7 and held as a sex slave for 7 years\n\nCary was molested by his uncle Bartered with his FBI interrogators for child pornography in exchange for a confession\n\nFormer girlfriends commented that he couldn\'t get aroused by adult women  only children Numerous viable suspects from a drug trafficking ring with evidence linking them to the Sund and Pelosso murders were found  and then immediately discarded following Stayner\'s confession Paul Candler  the ringleader of the drug group that included the initial suspects as well as Stayner  was a hitman for the corrupt Mariposa County law enforcement apparatus involved in drug importation\n\nOthers who are suspected of being in this group  but with less substantial evidence  include:\n\n""Monster of Florence"" - at various times  these killings have been linked to a Satanic cult led by the wealthy and powerful or Operation Gladio\n\nRichard Speck - him single-handedly subduing six women  then cutting a sheet into strips and tying them up one by one while the rest did nothing to resist  is highly implausible  but not totally impossible; until his alibi for the night of the murders is confirmed definitively  it can\'t be ruled out that Speck was guilty all by himself  even though a fair amount of compelling evidence points to him being a fall-guy\n\nCharles Whitman - the ""Texas Tower Sniper"" behind a mass shooting at the University of Texas in Austin; his note that he left the night before  when he killed his wife and mother  revealed he was facing an urge (of unknown origin) to kill  though later reports would indicate he had a brain tumor\n\nNorthern California\n\nCommonalities of serial killer cases Name Abuse and dissociation Pedophilia Government links Satanic/cult links Protection Railroading Parapolitical significance Stanley Baker Openly professed his involvement in ""Four P"" cult  a breakaway from the Process Church led by the ""Grand Chingon"" John Linley Frazier Herb Mullin Diagnosed with MPD  his alters included a Mexican laborer  an Eastern philosopher  and local columnist Herb Caen (whom Dave McGowan labels an ""unofficial Anton LaVey publicist"") As a young adult  he was institutionalized numerous times  including voluntarily to Mendocino State Hospital (which was overrun by the Peoples Temple) and a stay at a mental hospital (which Ed Sanders claimed was run by the US Army) in Hawaii (where Jim Jones had also spent time at a mental hospital in the 1960s  and where Ed Sanders claimed a mind control project to create serial killers was ongoing) Edmund Kemper Richard Chase\n\nSuperstars\n\nCommonalities of serial killer cases Name Abuse and dissociation Pedophilia Government links Satanic/cult links Protection Railroading Parapolitical significance Angelo Buono Was known to be attracted to underage girls  and married at least two of them As the mastermind behind the murders  who exerted a controlling influence on partner Kenneth Bianchi  he may have been a mind control ""handler"" of sorts\n\nRan a child prostitution ring whose clients included political and business elites such as a city councilman  a police chief  and a chief aide to a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors\n\nOne of his clients included mob figure Joe Bonanno\n\nMultiple connections to the Hollywood crowd (he had shared a home with actor Artie Ford and was acquainted with Frank Sinatra)  and some Hollywood figures were in turn suspects in the Hillside Strangler murders Kenneth Bianchi Was diagnosed with MPD by some of the doctors who examined him  although others (most of them connected to the CIA) claimed he was faking it Regularly visited a hospital under the pretense of getting outpatient treatments for cancer  which he didn\'t have  although he did bring home medical forms and receipts indicating he was getting some type of treatment John Wayne Gacy A police detective noted that ""His personality could change in a split second""\n\nIn his confession  Gacy attributed the murders to an alter personality named Jack Hanley Though Gacy alone was convicted for his crimes  it is apparent that some of his young male employees were complicit in finding victims and disposing of the bodies:\n\nIt was claimed that Gacy employees Michael Rossi and David Cram had no idea the holes he asked them to dig were graves  even though the stench of decaying flesh in his house was said to be overwhelming\n\nGacy himself acknowledged being a copycat of Dean Corll  who used two younger males to abduct victims for him to torture and murder\n\nAfter Russell Nelson disappeared  his friend Robert Young  who was with Nelson when he disappeared  started phoning his family to extort money from them  and when two family members came down to Chicago  Young offered them jobs with Gacy\n\nRossi moved in with John Mowery days before Mowery disappeared  insisted Mowery meet someone who was about to leave town (Gacy was about to head out of town)  and later told Mowery\'s friends that he knew about a place where a bunch of dead bodies were buried that police didn\'t know about\n\nEven more disturbingly  there is evidence that some of his employees killed victims on their own without Gacy being involved:\n\nSeveral of Gacy\'s employees had keys to his home  and at least one of them (Paske) was in a criminal enterprise that likely gave him his own motive to dump bodies there\n\nSome of the victims attributed to Gacy were abducted and murdered while plane tickets showed he was not even in Illinois Attained a high-level position in the Chicago Democratic Party  even meeting Rosalynn Carter\n\nGacy claimed to work for the Syndicate\n\nOne of his employees was Phillip Paske  the business partner of John Norman in a child trafficking ring whose clients likely included nationwide elites such as Alan Baer and Harold Andersen of Omaha\n\nGacy specialized in drugstore and pharmacy remodels  had a steady supply of drugs  and employed victim John Butkovich who was likely part of the drug trade with Puerto Ricans in Chicago Ted Bundy Acquaintances  an investigator  and the Colorado judge all commented on how Bundy\'s physical appearance could radically change depending on the situation  to the point where he didn\'t even look like the same person All of the Seattle victims either never turned up  turned up with certain organs selectively removed  or only turned up as skulls  leading to rumors that the killings were ritualistic\n\nPolice informants talked of seeing ""Ted"" leading cult gatherings  and drew connections to other serial killers like Stanley Baker and Thomas Creech with occult overtones\n\nTwo of the suspects in the Seattle murders who weren\'t Bundy later turned up in Utah and Colorado at the same time Bundy lived in those states  and were arguably better suspects for the physical murders themselves  raising the possibility that Bundy was leading a cult that traveled interstate Bundy was attributed responsibility for two attacks on the same day  those of Carol DaRonch and Debra Kent  even though the timing would almost certainly preclude his involvement in both  and DaRonch initially failed to identify Bundy while the main witness in the Kent case initially made an adamant ID of a local drug trafficker\n\nThe star witness in the Caryn Campbell murder trial identified not Bundy  but Pitkin County Undersheriff Ben Meyers  who had previously left his job as police chief of Grand Junction CO in the wake of corruption rumors\n\nIn the Chi Omega case  semen found in the bed of one of the Chi Omega victims was from a nonsecretor whereas Bundy was proven to be a secretor  and the bite mark evidence against him matched the state of his teeth after the murder which was different from before the murder Bundy\'s crimes frequently had some tie to law enforcement: one Utah victim was a police chief\'s daughter; corrupt police chief Meyers was identified instead of Bundy in the Campbell murder; Julie Cunningham was friends with the daughter of the Salem OR chief of detectives who used to work with Meyers; Bundy was seen by one witness at the same place and time of Linda Benson\'s murder  itself suspected of being linked to Meyers; before attacking Kimberly Leach  Bundy nearly abducted the daughter of prominent Jacksonville FL detective Jim Parmenter\n\nNext generation\n\nCommonalities of serial killer cases Name Abuse and dissociation Pedophilia Government links Satanic/cult links Protection Railroading Parapolitical significance Doug Clark Bobby Joe Long Cousin of Henry Lee Lucas One of his victims  Lana Long  was a former Los Angeles resident who had danced at many nightclubs including that of Eddie Nash  and was raising money before her murder to get out of town  perhaps to escape a local sex ring in Tampa rumored to be recruiting women for snuff films Richard Ramirez Was mentored by his older cousin Mike  who served in Vietnam as a Phoenix Program assassin\n\nCollectors\n\nCommonalities of serial killer cases Name Abuse and dissociation Pedophilia Government links Satanic/cult links Protection Railroading Parapolitical significance Leonard Lake Charles Ng Bob Berdella Appeared to have an interest in Satanism  though investigators disputed it The lead investigator  Troy Cole  was a ""former"" employee of the CIA Based on an FBI tip  Berdella was briefly a suspect in the Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin abductions in the Des Moines IA area\n\nOne entry in his torture log mentions Oliver North  and he felt compelled to explain it away as innocuous Gary Heidnik Entering the US Army with the intent of becoming a military policeman  they instead (likely as a form of ""blooding"") trained him as a medic and sent him to be an orderly at an Army hospital in West Germany  where he was experimented on with hallucinogenic drugs Jeffrey Dahmer Herb Baumeister Virgil Vandagriff  a private investigator hired by the missing victims\' families  seems to have delayed the identification of Baumeister. In August 1994  he was the first one to speak with a witness who had survived a visit to Fox Hollow Farm. One of Vandagriff\'s investigators tracked down the farm  but inexplicably showed the witness an aerial photograph  leaving him unable to identify the property. Vandagriff\'s secretary Connie Pierce  who had worked closely with the witness  died suddenly at age 46 in November 1997. As an Indianapolis law enforcement officer  Vandagriff was a strange character. He learned hypnosis in the mid 1970s from the LAPD and employed it in hundreds of cases throughout his career  including that of ""Speedway Bomber"" Brett Kimberlin.\n\nPatsies and assassins\n\nCommonalities of serial killer cases Name Abuse and dissociation Pedophilia Government links Satanic/cult links Protection Railroading Parapolitical significance Albert DeSalvo F. Lee Bailey  purportedly DeSalvo\'s defense attorney  has a record of being a legal fixer for intelligence operations\n\nThe confessions made by DeSalvo were extracted under hypnosis by William Joseph Bryan  a CIA-connected hypnotist who was likely involved in programming Sirhan Sirhan Nearly everyone on the task force initially believed multiple perpetrators were involved  something that was forgotten after DeSalvo confessed\n\nMany of the details given in DeSalvo\'s confessions were inaccurate  but nevertheless accepted by police\n\nDeSalvo was never tried for the murders  but ""defense"" attorney Bailey decided to defend him from sexual assault charges by essentially putting his own client on trial for murder\n\nTwo DNA samples collected from Mary Sullivan  one from a semen stain in her pubic hair  did not match DeSalvo\'s DNA according to a 2001 test; yet in 2013  there was suddenly a brand-new test confirming that DNA had matched to DeSalvo The more likely suspect in Patricia Bissette\'s murder was defense contractor Jules Rothman Arthur Shawcross Phoenix Program assassin during the Vietnam War Danny Rolling William Heirens\n\nOther likely subjects\n\nAfter Programmed to Kill was published  researchers have discovered other serial killers who fit the same profile described in McGowan\'s book:\n\nEd Gein\n\nPatrick Kearney (the Freeway Killer)\n\nGerard John Schaefer Jr.\n\nKenneth McKenna a.k.a.

While serving in the Army  he was known to have used LSD  a drug associated with the CIA\'s mind control experiments. Following Berkowitz\'s arrest  the New York Daily News on August 12  1977 ran a headline story ""SAM CHANGED AFTER LSD TRIPS"" detailing his ""devastating personality transformation"" after taking the drug while in Korea. Article is republished here: New York Daily News   ""Son of Sam\'s personality change was documented in letters to friends""  2017/08/03 Salt Lake Tribune   ""More Indictments Likely In \'Son of Sam\' Murders""  1977/08/18: ""An army friend said Berkowitz adopted the ""Son of Sam"" nickname to signify his belief that he was a pawn of the government — symbolized by Uncle Sam. Terry Peterson  24  McFarland  Wis.  said in an interview with the Madison Capital Times he and Berkowitz were ""best buddies"" when they spent a year together in Korea. ""When he\'d complain about what the Army was doing to him — and he took a lot of static after he field those conscientious objector forms — I\'d just tell him  \'Well  you signed up and now you\'re just a son of Sam \'"" said Peterson. ""What I meant was that he was a soldier for Uncle Sam and he was obligated to serve his country. But he took that to mean that he had become a pawn  a tool in some big game that the establishment was making him play. I\'m certain that\'s where the name (Son of Sam) came from. We used to call each other that all the time "" Peterson said."" According to p.80-81 of Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare by Michael Hoffman  upon joining the Army  Berkowitz became part of a special project for ""profiled"" candidates  during which he was dosed with drugs: ""Terry Patterson  an army buddy of Berkowitz  stated that when Berkowitz said he was the Son of Sam he was trying to say he was the Son of Uncle Sam; a creation of certain elements in the U.S. government. [...] David Berkowitz joined the U.S. Army  entering a special program for ""profiled"" candidates. Drugs were administered.""\n\nWork for IBI Security Services Agency ...\n\nRelationship with neo-Nazi and murderer Fred Cowan ** From p.303 of The Ultimate Evil: The Truth about the Cult Murders: Son of Sam & Beyond by Maury Terry (1999):\n\n\n\nMitteager explained that Cassara  from whom Berkowitz rented a room in early 1976  was a coworker of Fred Cowan — an avowed neo-Nazi who murdered six people before killing himself during a daylong siege at the Neptune Moving Company in New Rochelle on Valentine\'s Day 1977.\n\nMoreover  Berkowitz kept a file of news clippings on Cowan in his Yonkers apartment and had referred to him as ""one of the Sons.""\n\n\n\nSee the Son of Sam murders page for information on the murders themselves\n\nMonster of Florence\n\nCary Stayner\n\nRefer to the extensive collection of sources on the Cary Stayner page\n\nRichard Speck\n\nContemporaneous news articles The Capital Journal (Salem OR)  ""Chicago Police Sift Death Leads""  1966/07/16: """"We\'ve been inundated with phone calls  tips and leads since we added the sketch to our description "" said Michael Spiotto  deputy chief of detectives. [...] At least one mystery remained  however  and police shed no new light on it after the interview with Miss Amurao: Why were there no loud screams  no outcries for help  during the time the killer bound and gagged the nine girls  herded them into a back room  and led eight of them out one at a time to their deaths? ""There were some light outcries by the girls who came in late  but it wasn\'t much "" Spiotto said Miss Amurao told him. An autopsy report showed the girls had not been drugged to prevent screams. Three of them arrived home after the killer had already gathered the other six into the rear room. [...] The sketch drawn from Miss Amurao\'s description shows a crew-cut young man with high cheekbones  aquiline nose  jutting chin  narrow-set eyes beneath brows of medium thickness  and thin lips.

Merle Farmer gave the testimony to a Circuit Court jury trying Speck on charges of murdering the young women July 14  1966. Corazon Amurao  the only survivor of the massacre and the state\'s star witness  told the jurors last week that Speck came to the door of her bedroom about 11 p.m. July 13  and stayed in the house until about 3:30 a.m.  July 14. [...] Farmer  who works for Kay\'s Pilot House  about a mile and a half from the nurses\' townhouse residence on Chicago\'s South Side  told his story under questioning by defense attorney Gerald W.

Close to midnight. Q. What time was it when he left? A. I fix the time at between 12:15 and 12:30. Q. Did you see the lower part of his arm? A. I noticed a tattoo showing on his left arm. Farmer fixed his right hand at a spot above the elbow of his left arm. Speck has a tattoo on his left arm. [...] Getty also gave the jurors the original of a police bulletin featuring a sketch depicting the slayer as he was described by Miss Amurao. The sketch shows a man with a crewcut.

A clue to his identity was a pair of glasses found in the living room. A lieutenant for the Los Angeles Police Department  Robert Helder  showed them to the press on October 23 and said that the killer probably lost them during the struggle with the victims. There were fingerprint smudges on it but no identifiable ridges. The owner was extremely near-sighted and could not operate a vehicle without them. An unusual feature was the plastic lenses. Unlike glass lenses  plastic resisted shattering and was the choice of very active people such as athletes. The amber-colored  horn-rimmed frames were of a specific type manufactured by the American Optical Corp. The customized bend of the temple shafts showed that the left ear was about one-fourth to one-half inch higher than the right. Police sent flyers to thousands of eye doctors  hoping that someone might provide information about the man who bought them.\n\n\n\nWhat the news media hailed as a major breakthrough in October quickly became an almost forgotten loose end in December after the arrest of Charles Manson  Tex Watson  Susan Atkins  Patricia Krenwinkel  and Linda Kasabian  none of whom wore glasses.\n\n\n\nWhen the case came to trial  prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi feared that defense attorneys might bring up the glasses and make the reasonable assertion that at least one killer was still at large. From that standpoint  they could argue that the wrong people were on trial. [6] Augmenting the effectiveness of this strategy would be to identify and locate the doctor who prescribed the glasses. That man  as will be shown below  was Dr. Victor Ohta  a wealthy ophthalmologist in the town of Soquel in the Santa Cruz area  350 miles north of Los Angeles. As one of the state’s busiest eye surgeons  he specialized in the removal of cataracts. He and his family lived in a secluded mansion designed by Aaron Green  a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright  on a hilltop ten-acre site overlooking Monterey Bay."" ""On October 19  1970  three days before the glasses came up during the testimony of prosecution witness Roseanne Walker at the Manson family trial  [7] Mrs. Ohta was driving her green Oldsmobile station wagon home at about 5:00 pm. Calvin Penrod  a sales manager for mobile home parks  who knew Mrs. Ohta  was driving in close proximity to her car and noticed she had three passengers  young people with long hair. Behind Mrs. Ohta in the back seat was a man with a moustache; next to him was a woman with straight  long black hair; and a second man sat in the rear compartment behind the back seat. As it shortly turned out  the three passengers were highly trained  well-prepared killers. At the house they bound  blindfolded  and shot from behind Dr. and Mrs. Ohta  their two young sons  and the doctor’s secretary. Then they set fire to the house. The fierce blaze attracted the attention of two sheriff’s deputies  who called the fire department. Firemen attempting to reach the scene found both driveways blocked  one by Dr. Ohta’s Rolls Royce and the other by the secretary’s Continental  with the ignition keys snapped off in both locks. By the time they could push the cars aside  the mansion had already suffered extensive damage. While looking for a source of water  they found five bodies in the swimming pool.\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nMrs. Ohta’s station wagon served as the getaway car  driven wildly  nearly running other cars off the road. Witnesses saw three long-haired people in the careening car. At a campsite in the Bonny Doon area  witnesses saw three long-haired people  one of them a woman  near the station wagon. The following day the car was about a mile inside the Rincon railroad tunnel. An off-schedule Southern Pacific switch engine banged into it at 4:45 pm. Someone had driven it into the tunnel and set the seat cushions on fire (a destructive act similar to what happened to Kathleen Johns’ car). The engineer put out the flames with a fire extinguisher and then used his engine to push the car out of the tunnel. The motor was still warm from recent use. Three sets of footprints led from the spot where the car was abandoned to outside the tunnel.\n\n\n\nAlerted by a tip from “three long-haired persons” who provided the address of a woman who in turn gave directions to her husband’s tiny ramshackle hut in a wooded area in the Santa Cruz Mountains  sheriff’s deputies arrested John Linley Frazier  an auto mechanic who had dropped out of society and was living the hippie life-style. As soon as they took him into custody  the search for more suspects was discontinued. When newsmen asked District Attorney Peter Chang how one man could have bound  blindfolded  and shot five people with two pistols  a .38 and a .22  he said  “It sounds ridiculous  but it’s possible that it happened.”\n\n\n\nOriginally  Frazier denied killing the Ohtas. He said that three persons went into the Ohta house while he waited outside at the driveway entrance. He changed his story later  confessing to a psychologist that he killed the Ohtas single-handedly. The original story is probably the correct one  and his role that day was to serve as lookout.""\n\n): the pair of prescription eyeglasses found at the scene of the Tate murders  the origin of which authorities were investigating by talking to ophthalmologists\n\nHerb Mullin\n\nMind control program at a Hawaii mental hospital Interview of Mae Brussell by Tom Davis on 1980/12/08: ""Hawaii has been the scene of many clandestine operations.

She told him that they would stay with a “church group ” but Mullen was committed the day after his arrival to a mental hospital operated by the U.S. Army instead. He was given generous servings of LSD and other hallucinogenic drugs  not exactly standard therapeutic practice. In her December 20  1980 broadcast  Brussell related that Sanders informed her how Lawrence Quong  a raving gunman who shot at a San Francisco radio personality while on the air  “was taken to Hawaii by a woman and brought back to San Francisco with a mysterious gun placed in his hand.” The gun was unregistered  its origin unknown.

He traveled first to West Virginia  and then on to Southern California  where he stayed for at least six months. At around that same time  cousin Henry was living in Hemet  California. While in California  Long purportedly signed up for a $9 000 commercial diving class. How the chronically broke and under-employed Long was able to finance the diving lessons  as well as the trip itself  has never been explained—nor has his sudden interest in diving  which was apparently of no interest to him before or after his trip to California.

An associate of Lana’s had also recently left Los Angeles for Tampa  purportedly to pursue a film role  although you would normally expect that someone pursuing a career in film would head for L.A. Of course  this may not have been a typical film role; there was much talk among Tampa’s exotic dancers at the time of unidentified men recruiting women for nude modeling jobs and then using them in the production of snuff films. In the last hours of her life  Long was reportedly desperately trying to raise money to get out of town. Needless to say  she did not make it.

The senior Monahan had identified Adam\'s head. Three days after Adam\'s abduction  police took a machete from Michael Monahan  then 20  after a bizarre attack on another youngster at a Broward County skateboard park. Police now say they don\'t consider him a suspect in the Walsh case. John Monahan was out of town last week and could not be reached. His son could not be located for comment. From the beginning  police investigated rumors that Walsh  an executive at a Hollywood resort hotel with business connections to Bahamian casinos  had mob ties and that Adam\'s slaying was some sort of retaliation or related to drugs. But none of the rumors was ever proved true. One detective told The Miami Herald in 1982  ``This is a family with no skeletons in its closet. "" From p.284 of Tears of Rage: From Grieving Father to Crusader for Justice : the Untold Story of the Adam Walsh Case by John Walsh (1997): ""At that meeting  Dick Witt  the Hollywood police chief  was asked point-blank if there was any official suspicion that I was somehow affiliated with the Mafia. We were all sitting there  expecting him to say how ridiculous even the idea of that was. Instead  what Witt said was  ""Anyone who goes to [here he mentioned a well-known Fort Lauderdale restaurant] for lunch has something to do with the Mafia."""" From p.392-394 of The Unsolved Murder of Adam Walsh: Book Two: Finding the Victim by Arthur Jay Harris (2016) - more information on the page about Allen Rivenbark:\n\n\n\nMonahan had his own reasons to be upset at Grelen. He\'d first reported that his son Michael had once been a suspect in the murder  and as well that John Monahan himself was linked to a suspected Miami drug smuggler.\n\nIn addition to being a friend of the Walsh family like his father  Michael Monahan was also a close friend of Jimmy Campbell. But in 1990  Michael had been convicted in federal court in Tampa along with three others of extortion to collect a $40 000 debt on a loan from a man who was found shot dead after he\'d gone to police. A codefendant was the son of a reputed captain in the Lucchese crime family of New York  who lived in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1981  three days after Adam\'s abduction  in the Broward County city of Oakland Park there was an argument over a skateboard. Michael was carrying it  another young man claimed it was his and took it from Michael  then ran into the office of the skateboard park and locked the door. Minutes later  Michael returned with a machete and began hacking at it.\n\n“He was outside the door telling me if I didn\'t open the door that he was going to cut me up ” Grelen quoted the other young man telling an Oakland Park policeman. Soon  he saw the blade coming through the door. “I was in fear for my life. I thought he was going to kill me. He was enraged  like he was under the influence or something. You just don\'t get that mad over a skateboard.”\n\nMonahan took back his skateboard and left. That evening  Oakland Park police confiscated his machete and later had the Broward Medical Examiner test it to see if it matched the cuts in the neck of the found child. The result wasn\'t conclusive.\n\nIn November 1981  three months after John Monahan identified Adam  he arrived at another morgue  in the Rocky Mountains  Grelen reported. A private turbojet had crashed carrying seven bound from Opa-locka airport in Dade. All had been killed and body parts were scattered  even in trees. One victim was Monahan\'s twenty-three years younger fiancée.\n\nAnother was Allen Rivenbark  who at the time of his death six federal and state law enforcement agencies were investigating for suspected drug smuggling  money laundering  and harboring fugitives  the Denver Post reported in January 1982. The story said that Rivenbark owned a secluded mountain ranch thirty miles from Vail which was suspected of being a “hideout” for East Coast mobsters as well as a distribution point for drug trafficking in Colorado resort areas. The seven crash victims were all headed there. Rivenbark was also the jet\'s owner and part-owner of a coffee plantation in Colombia  Grelen reported.\n\nThe Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune had it too  a UPI story published November 22  1981: Airplane in Colorado Crash Was Being Watched by DEA . The story said the plane “was under surveillance by officers monitoring a cocaine smuggling operation  a federal agent said.”\n\nSaid Wayne Valentine  chief of the DEA\'s Denver office  “It is a very likely possibility the plane was carrying cocaine” from South America to the United States.\n\nAt the crash site investigators had found thirty handguns—one holstered to a victim\'s leg—and $50-60 000 in cash in the fresh snow  Grelen wrote.\n\nHe quoted Bill Bachman  the chief investigator in 1981 for the sheriff\'s office of Eagle County  Colo.  that when Monahan arrived  “He had a bodyguard with him that was a gorilla.” Monahan claimed and identified six of the bodies  excluding only a man with a Japanese name who was thought to be Rivenbark\'s bodyguard.\n\n“He made arrangements for dental records. He kind of took charge of the whole situation. That was kind of unusual ” said Bachman.\n\nBachman added that as he investigated the crash  he received death threats by telephone.\n\nReddit comment by MandyHVZ in 2020: ""He was most assuredly not lying about them being connected only by Adam  at the time  and then by the crusade in Adam\'s name. I can confirm from inside sources at NCMEC that they remained married in name only  essentially for the ""brand""  and didn\'t live or even travel together at all by the time I was working at NCMEC-- even for big deal stuff like the NCMEC board meeting  they were never even so much as entering the building on the same day.

W. or A.W. Gossip Extra   ""Crime Writer: Adam Walsh is Alive And Well  And Living in Miami!""  2014/03/05\n\nPossibility that both of the accused killers (Ottis Toole and Jeffrey Dahmer) were involved Suggestion that Ottis Toole and Jeffrey Dahmer worked together to murder Adam Walsh From p.56 of The Unsolved Murder of Adam Walsh: Book Two: Finding the Victim by Arthur Jay Harris (2016):\n\n\n\n""Within an hour of their arrival  A. W. said he saw Ottis Toole. And later  Ted Bundy. I quickly found that Bundy  who had abducted young women in Miami  had been in custody since 1978. Black mark. Toole and Dahmer  simpatico? Because Mary Hagan had said she\'d seen Toole at Sears  Willis and I had joked  what were the odds that two famous killers coincidentally had gone to Hollywood Mall at the same time? Who got to Adam first? We\'d never considered they could have been in league together. (Like Broward State Attorney investigator Phil Mundy  we simply dismissed William Mistler. Willis thought Hagan actually saw Dahmer but when she watched America\'s Most Wanted show video of Toole she overwrote her memory and put Toole\'s face and movements on Dahmer—just like what we believed happened to Bowen.) A. W. said he didn\'t see Toole at the mall  but couldn\'t say he wasn\'t there.\n\nInside the apartment  as he referred to it  A. W. said there were other captors too. They were holding about twelve children  ages 4-7  all but two of them boys  intended to be sold into ""the flesh market "" which he described as prostitution  slavery  and the organ trade. I had trouble believing that until two months later when I read stories in the wake of the 2010 Haitian earthquake that Haiti has an active trade in child prostitution and slavery. A. W. had said that one of his other captors had taken him to voodoo rituals (South Florida has a large Haitian community)  and he\'d described an altar in the apartment that included his ""Missing"" picture. I also saw a Miami Herald story quoting a local child advocate and former state prosecutor: ""Miami is known as a destination city for human trafficking.""\n\nFrom p.267 of The Unsolved Murder of Adam Walsh: Book Two: Finding the Victim by Arthur Jay Harris (2016): ""Look at the dates  the end of 1980 and the spring of \'81. Now add that in May they were in Dade County. [...] Now that I think we\'re safe in establishing that Lucas and Toole really were killers  and they\'d been in South Florida at least the end of May 1981  we can say for sure that three serial killers at the same time had been in the same place: Sunny Isles."" From p.268 of The Unsolved Murder of Adam Walsh: Book Two: Finding the Victim by Arthur Jay Harris (2016): ""Aside from A. W. saying that Dahmer and Toole were together on July 27  could I objectively show that Dahmer  Toole  and Lucas knew each other?"" From p.270-271 of The Unsolved Murder of Adam Walsh: Book Two: Finding the Victim by Arthur Jay Harris (2016)  it is mentioned that Lucas saw Toole in the company of a ""friend"" in Miami who resembled Dahmer:\n\n\n\nThere was also a reference to something that sounded like the killing of Haack and Karbin  but it was written in the author\'s narrative  not Lucas\'s: ""Henry\'s memory didn\'t reveal that he\'d killed and robbed two women during his blackout... Leaving Ottis and his friend in Miami  he drove north."" Call published in 1985  Dade County had indicted Lucas for Haack and Karbin\'s murders in 1984.\n\nWho was Ottis\'s friend? A few paragraphs earlier  Call described him and the scene:\n\n""Getting ready to leave Miami  Henry ran into Ottis in a bar. This wasn\'t unusual because it was a common hangout for members of the Hand . It was a contact point where orders for contract killings could be picked up  or simply a place where superiors could find loyal and willing servants for Satan.\n\n""Ottis was traveling with an effeminate friend  but the man\'s pale blue eyes were cold as ice.""\n\nEyes cold as ice? Let\'s review some of the observations of Dahmer I gathered:\n\nWillis: ""He had a look on him  like the Devil was in him."" Ken Haupert  Sr.: ""I saw hell in his eyes once."" Billy Capshaw: ""An expression like he just wasn\'t there... If you\'ve ever seen that—I promise you  you will never forget that eye contact."" Linda Swisher: ""his eyes were like ice.""\n\nWere Dahmer\'s eyes blue? That\'s what the FBI wrote in a narrative document dated August 16  1991.\n\nI read the line in Call\'s book to Billy  and he reacted  ""Wow  that\'s good."" He said Jeff\'s eyes changed colors depending on the light and maybe even the season. ""I looked at his eyes a lot. They\'re not a deep blue  not the kind of blue that jumped out at you  a beautiful blue."" Instead  he called them ""grayish-blue "" or ""fluffy-blue."" ""Between pale blue and grayish-blue "" he said.\n\nI asked the same to Preston Davis  who had also been in Billy and Jeff\'s barracks in Baumholder  except that Preston had left in the beginning of 1980 and Billy had replaced him  so they had never met until recently  on the phone  then later in person. ""Blue eyes "" he said. Were they pale blue? ""Light blue "" he said. He said Jeff\'s gaze  when he was drunk  could be ""intimidating.""\n\nWas Jeff effeminate? Not in his TV interviews. Billy said Jeff usually would hold himself in ""a manly way. But around the right people  that might have changed."" Privately to Billy  he ""prissed around  happy-prissy"" when he was drinking. He\'d shake his butt  drop his hand in a limp-wristed way  and turn his head ""the way a gay man does "" as well as be ""happy and jumpy."" Jeff didn\'t show that to most people  ""but if you were around him a lot "" as Billy was  you would have seen it  he said. When I asked that to Davis  he said he\'d never seen it but he didn\'t doubt what Billy said.\n\nI asked A. W. if he\'d seen it. Yes  he said. ""The way he\'d move his hands  like an Egyptian""—his actual reference was the song ""Walk like an Egyptian."" He saw it ""when he\'d try to minimize my pain.\n\n""He had a gay voice  when he started to get aroused  I guess. He descended into this gay persona"" as well as cross-dressed  he said. ""He seemed like a tough kind of person  then he\'d become this wacky kind of gay person when he got behind closed doors.""\n\nAfter first publication of this book  another man found me on Facebook and said that Dahmer had tried to pick him up using an obviously gay voice.\n\nSean Adams said the incident had occurred in Morgan City  Louisiana  a bayou town  where Adams grew up. He was eleven at the time. He knew of my Dahmer books but had not read them.\n\nFrom p.275-276 of The Unsolved Murder of Adam Walsh: Book Two: Finding the Victim by Arthur Jay Harris (2016):\n\n\n\nLucas told the FBI in May 1984 that after his initial training in the Everglades with the cult he occasionally renewed it  the last time being in 1981. Some cult gatherings  he said  were at night on a deserted beach just south of Fort Lauderdale  held annually he thought in June or July. (That sounded to me very much like John U. Lloyd State Recreation Area  just south of Port Everglades  on the barrier island dividing the Intracoastal Waterway from the ocean. Its only land access happens to be a mile or less from where Flo Ella Miller\'s body was found in a canal  two days after Adam disappeared. That or Hollywood\'s North Beach  then undeveloped  which is also within about the same distance as where Miller was found. Every other beach possibly fitting that description had homes  apartments  or hotels on it.) Dahmer was in South Florida starting at the end of March \'81. Maybe for some of his poorly-accounted time here from then to when Ken Haupert saw him go through his dumpster looking for food  in May or June  he was training with the cult. Whomever Lucas is describing with Toole  he\'s implying he\'s a cult member  hanging at a cult hangout bar.\n\n[...]\n\nMight it fit that Dahmer was part of the Hand? As Lucas had it  they murdered for Satan  trained how not to leave clues of their crimes  and practiced cannibalism. To the Milwaukee Police  Dahmer had admitted checking out Satanism while he was living with his churchgoing grandmother in West Allis  Wisconsin  in the early 1980s: ""He stated he felt he did this because he felt that since religion wasn\'t working  maybe he should just delve into the occult and to Satanism. However  after reading several books and dabbling in it  he realized this was not for him.""\n\nThat Dahmer\'s dabble with devil-worship was brief isn\'t credible. His father Lionel wrote in his book that when Jeff was 18 in 1978  Lionel broke up a seance party at their house and found a chalk pentagram drawn on a table. Also  in 1991 in his Milwaukee apartment police found an occult altar that included skulls. Exactly where Dahmer would have made the connection to the Hand  who knows? But I\'ll toss this out: after he left the Army  did he come to Miami not because  as the Milwaukee Police says he told them  ""he thought it would be nice with the warm weather all the time "" but because he already was part of the cult?\n\nLater in the chapter (starting on p.279)  Arthur Jay Harris mentions being contacted in November 2014 by a witness named Charles Sutera who claimed to have seen Jeffrey Dahmer and Ottis Toole together at Hollywood Mall when Adam Walsh was kidnapped. He attempts  with some success  to reconcile Sutera\'s story with the recollections of other witnesses  some of whom saw both a blue van (owned by Dahmer) and a white car (perhaps owned by Toole). From p.361-362 of The Unsolved Murder of Adam Walsh: Book Two: Finding the Victim by Arthur Jay Harris (2016)  there is a reference to Lawrence E. King (a.k.a. Larry King) from the Franklin scandal being the boss of Dahmer and Toole in their child trafficking enterprise:\n\n\n\nThere is a statement on the record in the Walsh file about Toole going to Miami in around 1976.\n\nIn 1996  fishing for information  Phil Mundy had asked Toole\'s niece Sarah Patterson (Frank and Frieda Powell\'s older sister) if Ottis had ever mentioned a man named Larry Waldo  who had come up in the investigation but was ultimately dropped. Patterson didn\'t know any last names but responded  “Whenever he used to go up to Miami he would always tell me I am going to see Larry.” She didn\'t know much more  except that Ottis had first mentioned that name around the time Patterson had first gotten married  in 1976.\n\nA. W. had told me that when he was tortured in Miami Beach  Dahmer and Toole had a boss who was present. Without getting into it—I have never been able to confirm this  except that the man has a federal criminal record and was separately alleged to have led a pedophile ring elsewhere that kidnapped children and adolescents—A. W. said his name was is Larry  his surname not Waldo.\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Gein\n\n""Programmed To Kill/Satanic Cover-Up Part 14 (David Parker Ray & Ed Gein)""  2011/05/03\n\nWikipedia article on Ed Gein - has some provocative details about his background: ""Around this time [after his mother\'s death]  he became interested in reading death-cult magazines and adventure stories  particularly those involving cannibals or Nazi atrocities.""

Three days after classes convened  on September 8  a mysterious fate overtook a former neighbor  the object of his teenage lust and rage.\n\n\n\nLee Hainline had married Charles Bonadies on August 21  1969. It was a rocky union from the start  with frequent quarrels. One bone of contention was Leigh’s announcement that her childhood neighbor and sometime tennis partner had offered her a $20 000 salary to join the CIA. Charles laughed at the idea and told her to forget it. On September 8  he came home to find a note from Leigh  saying the she had gone to Miami. She never came back  and her car was later found in a Fort Lauderdale parking lot. Leigh’s brother called Schaefer and heard a strange story: Leigh had phoned him  Schaefer claimed  to say that she was leaving Charles and asked him for a ride to the airport  where she meant to catch a flight to Cincinnati. Schaefer agreed  but Leigh never called back with a departure time. Charles filed for divorce on October 6  his petition granted on March 10  1970. Nothing more was heard of Leigh Bonadies until her jewelry surfaced at Doris Schaefer’s home  in April 1973. Her fate remains unknown."" ""The next to vanish from Broward County was Carmen Marie Hallock  a 22-year-old cocktail waitress. She had lunch with her sister-in-law on December 18  1969  discussing a date she had planned for that evening. Hallock said she was meeting a teacher who had offered her a job involving “some kind of undercover work for the government.” The position featured international travel and “lots of money.” Hallock missed work the next night and when she had not been seen by Christmas Day  her relatives used a spare key to check her apartment. They found the bathtub full and her dog unfed. Hallock’s car found in a nearby parking lot a few days later. When Schaefer’s stash of souvenirs was seized in 1973  police recovered two of Hallock’s gold-filled teeth and a shamrock pin identified by her family. Her body has never been found."" ""By October 1970  to make tuition money  Schaefer was working as a security guard at Florida Light and Power. There  he met secretary Teresa Dean and they became engaged  tying the knot soon after Schaefer’s August 1971 graduation from FAU  with a bachelor’s degree in geography. It was useless without a teaching credential  but Schaefer had chosen a new career path.\n\n\n\nHaving failed to “do right” as a priest or teacher  he set his sights on law enforcement. Hired by the Wilton Manors Police Department on September 3  1971  Schaefer was sent back to Broward Community College  this time to the school’s police academy. He graduated on December 17  1971 and hit the streets to begin his six-month probationary term. Schaefer was on the job barely three weeks before another local woman disappeared."" ""[Wilton Manors police chief Bernard] Scott was ready to fire Schaefer on March 16  1972  when Schaefer surprised him by winning a commendation for a drug arrest. It saved his job  but only briefly. [...]"" ""Teresa Schaefer made her one and only prison visit on November 17  1973  to serve Gerard with divorce papers. Outside the walls  reporters trumpeted that lawyer Elton Schwarz  age 45  was “dating” Schaefer’s 21-year-old wife. He also handled Teresa’s divorce and they were married on November 30 with Schwarz announcing that his client had suggested the arrangement. Inmate Schaefer  undismayed  maintained correspondence with Schwarz for several years afterward  waiting nearly a decade to charge the attorney with legal malpractice."" ""Meanwhile  Schaefer was busy exposing another conspiracy  claiming that he had been framed by drug-dealing lawmen and Martin County prosecutors. (This despite his statements to psychiatrists that he enjoyed working for Sheriff Crowder “because everybody was honest.”) In Schaefer’s new scenario  he was framed for killing “two narcotics informants” because he refused to play ball with powerful drug lords. Ironically  one of Robert Stone’s aides was convicted of drug trafficking in the 1980s  but no evidence linked the case to Schaefer’s crimes."" ""When not scamming “freaks ” Schaefer worked as a jailhouse lawyer--with a twist. While writing briefs for fellow cons  he milked his “clients” for information on their cases  then sold them out to authorities. One such inmate  awaiting trial for murder  told Schaefer where his victim’s body could be found and Schaefer relayed the directions to police  landing his client on death row. [...]"" - ed. note: this is probably illegal ""In 1986  collaborating with police from North Miami  Schaefer adopted the guise of “Dee Dee Kelly ” a 14-year-old prostitute who offered nude photos to pedophiles. Responses to his ads were collected by U.S. Postal inspectors  but none of Schaefer’s correspondents were prosecuted. Instead  authorities discovered he was working with another inmate  Mervyn Cross  to run a child pornography network from prison. Cross paid Schaefer’s father a monthly stipend for use of his telephone line  to communicate with Filipino colleagues. Prosecutors convicted Cross  adding time to his sentence at Starke  but no charges were filed against the Schaefers."" ""The bizarre flip-side of that pious façade was Schaefer’s effort to pose as a leader of organized crime. On March 21  1989 he wrote: “I am  factually  a captain of the Dixie Mafia...I have  factually  the power to have you killed. I have  in the past  used these powers.” Three days later he added  “I am a Syndicate man... When I put on my [mob] subchief’s hat I am ‘Don El Tigre’...and I can scare the living shit out of you.”"" ""[In his June 19  1992 letter to Sondra London] Schaefer could not resist signing off with a warning: “The very next time you say or do anything that causes me problems...I am going to encourage my dope addled Satanist pals in Georgia to go pick up your slut daughter and teach her some sex education.”"" ""[...] Forensic dentist Richard Souviron  who identified Carmen Hallock’s teeth in 1973  received a summons for providing photos and fragments of Schaefer’s writings to a British magazine. [...]"" ""[...] Finally barred from writing to London directly  Schaefer penned a furious letter to her publisher on December 5  1993. Referring to a fellow convict--“an Anointed Fourth Prince of the Hand of Death”--he raved: “All I need to do is ask this gentleman to have SL and her kid murdered and it would be done. SL is alive at this moment because I choose to allow it.”"" ""On Sunday  December 3  prison guards found Schaefer slaughtered in his cell. His throat was slashed and he had been stabbed 42 times around his head and neck. A bloody handprint on the wall of Schaefer’s cell appeared to be the only clue.\n\n\n\nTwo months later  on February 1  1996  prison officials filed a murder charge against 33-year-old Vincent Faustino Rivera  confessed slayer of two Hillsborough County victims  who had begun serving a sentence of life plus 20 years in January 1991. According to the state’s scenario  Rivera and Schaefer had quarreled after Schaefer took the last cup of hot water from a dispenser on their cell block. Rivera had brooded a while  then settled the argument with a homemade shank."" ""In November 1996 Rivera wrote to Sondra London  pleading innocence and claiming that the bloody print from Schaefer’s cell matched neither Schaefer nor himself. Schaefer’s mother and sister accused Ottis Toole of the murder  alleging that Toole had felt threatened by Schaefer’s ongoing efforts to help the Walsh family recover young Adam’s remains. The National Enquirer reported that Schaefer had arranged to speak with detectives concerning the case  angling for a transfer back to Avon Park if he could produce Adam’s bones.

I drove out to their fancy digs in an expensive bedroom community West of Fort Lauderdale and when Caeser came to the door I put a dozen slugs into the fat bastard; then I ran down his cutie pie wife  Patty  and put about another dozen bullets into her. [...] Caeser Vitale had a partner  Mike Papa  and Mike was told to make good on the scammed cash or he and his fancy wife  Carla  would get what Caeser and Patty got. Mike Papa was connected with the Luchese Syndicate; in fact it was Mike\'s uncle  Vinnie Papa  who was the brains behind the 50 million dollar ""French Connection"" heroin heist in New York City. The South Americans felt that Mike could get up the money from the Luchese Syndicate but he either couldn\'t do it or he didn\'t care; so about six months after I blasted the Vitales I flew up to New York  drove out to Queens and executed Mike and Carla Papa. [...] "" South Florida Sun Sentinel   ""DEAD END IN SUBURBIA""  1992/02/09: ""Caesar Vitale  35  was an interior decorator who regularly visited a manicurist and drove a Mercedes-Benz. His wife Patty  33  was a rental manager at Inverrary in Lauderhill. She had her own Mercedes  a fine wardrobe and nine credit cards. The couple enjoyed dining out and buying expensive gold jewelry. They lived in a three-bedroom  two-bath  2 400-square-foot lakefront home which they had bought new in a peaceful neighborhood of Plantation. [...] 10 years ago  on Feb. 15  1982  the Vitales\' veneer of upscale normalcy came to a savage and bloody end. On that evening  a Sunday  somebody entered the Vitales\' home as they sat in the family room watching Channel 10. As Caesar  clad only in blue corduroy shorts  walked toward the door  the intruder mowed him down with a .380-caliber semiautomatic or automatic weapon. He was shot 12 times. The killer then chased Patty  shooting her 11 times. Next he stabbed Caesar four times and his wife 11 times. Then he slit their throats. [...] Most law-enforcement officers believe the murders were drug-related. ""It was a dope deal that went bad "" says former Fort Lauderdale FBI agent Al La-Manna."" ""Vitale grew up in Brooklyn across the street from Joseph Colombo  don of the New York-based Mafia crime family that still bears his name nearly 14 years after his death.\n\n\n\nVitale was a pal of Colombo\'s three sons  Joe Jr.  Anthony and Vincent. When he was in his early 20s he was appointed secretary-treasurer of the Italian- American Civil Rights League  an organization founded by Colombo in 1971 to counter what he said was the maligning of Italian-Americans in unfounded stories about the Mafia. Vitale also served for a time as Joe Colombo\'s bodyguard  according to New York Police Department intelligence files."" ""After Joe Colombo was critically wounded in an assassination attempt and replaced as boss of his crime family  his sons moved to Florida. Here they hoped to start a Florida-New York narcotics network  according to New York police intelligence reports.\n\n\n\nVitale  a graduate of New York\'s Fashion Institute of Technology  was not far behind them in moving here."" """"Caesar was involved in drug traffic with the (Colombo) family on a large scale "" New York cops said in a report to Plantation police after Vitale\'s murder.\n\n\n\nAccording to Al LaManna  the ex-FBI agent  Vitale was placed in charge of a furniture store in Oakland Park owned by the Colombo crime family. Law- enforcement agencies suspected that heroin was being smuggled in with furniture imported by the store from overseas.\n\n\n\nOne of the store\'s customers was the Fairways at Inverrary  and it may have been at this time that Caesar and Patty renewed their friendship."" - note that heroin being smuggled in furniture resembles the trafficking ring of Ike Atkinson and perhaps Michael Hand through Nugan Hand ""Vitale subsequently left the furniture store to manage the West End restaurant at the Sunrise Musical Theatre. A short time later he became manager of the Executive House hotel at Inverrary. Now  more than ever  he was mingling with mobsters.\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\n""Caesar Vitale ran the Executive House  and during this time it became one of the principal places for various organized-crime

They released a copy of the note found on his phone that appeared to redact the names of specific people he mentioned.\n\nIt was not clear when the note was written  but in it Bing claimed he was harassed and said he was pushed to the brink by a perception his phone was hacked.\n\nHe wrote  “My only wish would have been to start over from scratch and that my parents would have paid closer attention to my social deficits.” Bing died at the scene of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nCoworkers of Bing who survived the shooting said he was difficult and known for being hostile with employees. One survivor said Bing seemed to target people and fired at some victims after they were already hit.\n\nJessica Wilczewski said workers were gathered in a store break room to begin their overnight shift late Tuesday when Bing  a team leader  entered and opened fire. While another witness has described Bing as shooting wildly  Wilczewski said she observed him target certain people.\n\n“The way he was acting — he was going hunting ” Wilczewski told The Associated Press on Thursday. “The way he was looking at people’s faces and the way he did what he did  he was picking people out.”\n\nWilczewski said she had only worked at the store for five days and being a new employee may have been the reason she was spared.\n\nShe said she was hiding under a table after the shooting started and that at one point  Bing told her to get out from under the table. But when he saw who she was  he told her  “Jessie  go home.”\n\nFormer coworkers and residents of Chesapeake  a city of about 250 000 people near Virginia’s coast  have been struggling to make sense of the rampage.\n\nBing’s death note rambles at times through 11 paragraphs  with references to nontraditional cancer treatments and songwriting. He says people unfairly compared him to serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer  and wrote: “I would have never killed anyone who entered my home.”\n\nAnd he wished for a wife but wrote he didn’t deserve one.\n\nSome who worked with Bing  31  said he had a reputation for being an aggressive  if not hostile  supervisor who once admitted to having “anger issues.” But he also could make people laugh and seemed to be dealing with the typical stresses at work that many people endure.\n\n“I don’t think he had many people to fall back on in his personal life ” said Nathan Sinclair  who worked at the Walmart for nearly a year before leaving earlier this month.\n\nDuring chats among coworkers  “We would be like ‘work is consuming my life.’ And (Bing) would be like  ‘Yeah  I don’t have a social life anyway ’” Sinclair recalled Thursday.\n\nSinclair said he and Bing did not get along. Bing was known for being “verbally hostile” to employees and wasn’t particularly well-liked. But Sinclair also said there were times when Bing was made fun of.\n\nPolice have identified the victims as Brian Pendleton  38; Kellie Pyle  52; Lorenzo Gamble  43; Randy Blevins  70  and Fernando Chavez-Barron  16  who were all from Chesapeake; and Tyneka Johnson  22  of nearby Portsmouth. Chavez-Barron’s name was released Friday; it had been withheld previously because of his age.\n\nTwo others who were shot remained hospitalized  police said Friday. One is still in critical condition  and the other is in fair to improving condition.\n\nSix people were wounded in the shooting  which happened just after 10 p.m. as shoppers were stocking up ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Police said they believe about 50 people were in the store at the time.\n\nBing was identified as an overnight team leader who had been a Walmart employee since 2010. Police said he had one handgun and several magazines of ammunition.\n\nWalmart employee Briana Tyler said the overnight stocking team of 15 to 20 people had just gathered in the break room to go over the morning plan. Another team leader had begun speaking when Bing entered the room and opened fire  Tyler and Wiczewski said.\n\nThe attack was the second major shooting in Virginia this month. Three University of Virginia football players were fatally shot on a bus on Nov. 13 as they returned from a field trip. Two other students were wounded.\n\nThe Walmart shooting also comes days after a person opened fire at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs  Colorado — killing five and wounding 17. Tuesday night’s shooting brought back memories of another attack at a Walmart in 2019  when a gunman killed 23 at a store in El Paso  Texas.\n\nAlso on Friday  a person suffered injuries not considered life-threatening after being shot at a Walmart in Lumberton  North Carolina  police said. Investigators described it as an isolated altercation between two people who knew each other.\n\n(Source: The Associated Press)'],walmart supervisor fatally shot six co worker store virginia buy gun hour killing leave note phone accuse colleague mock authority say friday n nsorry everyone plan promise thing fell place like lead satan andre bing write note leave phone chesapeake police department say friday n npolice say mm handgun use tuesday night shoot legally purchase morning bing criminal record release copy note find phone appear redact name specific people mention n nit clear note write bing claimed harass say push brink perception phone hack n nhe write wish would start scratch parent would pay close attention social deficit bing die scene apparent self inflict gunshot wound n ncoworkers bing survive shoot say difficult know hostile employee one survivor say bing seem target people fire victim already hit n njessica wilczewski say worker gather store break room begin overnight shift late tuesday bing team leader enter opened fire another witness describe bing shoot wildly wilczewski say observed target certain people n nthe way act go hunt wilczewski told associate press thursday way look people face way pick people n nwilczewski say work store five day new employee may reason spar n nshe say hide table shooting start one point bing tell get table saw tell jessie go home n nformer coworkers resident chesapeake city people near virginias coast struggle make sense rampage n nbings death note ramble time paragraphs reference nontraditional cancer treatment songwriting say people unfairly compare serial killer jeffrey dahmer write would never kill anyone enter home n nand wish wife write didnt deserve one n nsome work bing say reputation aggressive hostile supervisor admit anger issue also could make people laugh seem deal typical stress work many people endure n ni dont think many people fall back personal life say nathan sinclair work walmart nearly year leave early month n nduring chat among coworkers would like work consume life bing would like yeah dont social life anyway sinclair recall thursday n nsinclair say bing get along bing know verbally hostile employee wasnt particularly well like sinclair also say time bing make fun n npolice identify victim brian pendleton kellie pyle lorenzo gamble randy blevins fernando chavez barron chesapeake tyneka johnson nearby portsmouth chavez barrons name release friday withhold previously age n ntwo others shoot remain hospitalized police say friday one still critical condition fair improve condition n nsix people wound shoot happen p shopper stock ahead thanksgiving holiday police say believe people store time n nbing identified overnight team leader walmart employee since police say one handgun several magazine ammunition n nwalmart employee briana tyler say overnight stock team people gather break room go morning plan another team leader begin speak bing enter room open fire tyler wiczewski say n nthe attack second major shoot virginia month three university virginia football player fatally shoot bus nov return field trip two student wound n nthe walmart shoot also come day person open fire gay nightclub colorado spring colorado kill five wound tuesday night shoot bring back memory another attack walmart gunman kill store el paso texas n nalso friday person suffer injury consider life threaten shot walmart lumberton north carolina police say investigator describe isolated altercation two people know n n source associated press,0.6376731517085931,1

They’re going to be terrified to open their door ″ said Weldon resident Ruby Works  who was close to one of the victims.\n\nPolice  meanwhile  said a vehicle reportedly carrying the two suspects had been spotted in Regina  about 335 kilometers (208 miles) south of the communities where the stabbings occurred.\n\nRegina police chief Evan Bray said late Sunday they still believe the suspects are in Regina.\n\n“If in the Regina area  take precautions & consider sheltering in place. Do not leave a secure location. DO NOT APPROACH suspicious persons. Do not pick up hitch hikers. Report suspicious persons  emergencies or info to 9-1-1. Do not disclose police locations ” the RCMP said in a message on Twitter.\n\nThe suspects were identified as Damien Sanderson  31  and Myles Sanderson  30.\n\n“It is horrific what has occurred in our province today ” said Rhonda Blackmore  the Assistant Commissioner of the RCMP in Saskatchewan  adding there were 13 crime scenes where either deceased or injured people were found.\n\nBlackmore said some of the victims appear to have been targeted by the suspects but others appear to have been attacked at random.\n\nShe couldn’t provide a motive  but the chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations gave a statement suggesting the stabbings could be drug related.\n\nThe elected leaders of the three communities that make up the James Smith Cree Nation  including the Chakastaypasin Band and the Peter Chapman Band  declared a local state of emergency and opened up two emergency operations centers.\n\nChakastaypasin Chief Calvin Sanderson - who is not related to the suspects - said everyone’s been affected by the tragic events.\n\n“They were our relatives  friend ″ Sanderson said of the victims. “It’s pretty horrific.”\n\n“This is the destruction we face when harmful illegal drugs invade our communities  and we demand all authorities to take direction from the Chiefs and Councils and their membership to create safer and healthier communities for our people ” said Chief Bobby Cameron of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations.\n\nAmong the 10 victims killed was Lana Head  who is the former partner of Michael Brett Burns  and the mother of their two daughters.\n\nBurns told the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network that ""It’s sick how jail time  drugs and alcohol can destroy many lives ” he said. “I’m hurt for all this loss.”\n\nLast May  Saskatchewan Crime Stoppers issued a wanted list that included Myles Sanderson  writing that he was “unlawfully at large.”\n\nIt is among the deadliest mass killings in Canadian history. The deadliest gun rampage in Canadian history happened in 2020 when a man disguised as a police officer shot people in their homes and set fires across the province of Nova Scotia  killing 22 people. A man used a van to kill 10 pedestrians in Toronto in 2019. But mass killings are less common in Canada than in the United States.\n\nDeadly mass stabbings are more rare than mass shootings but have happened around the world. In 2014  29 people were slashed and stabbed to death at a train station in China’s southwestern city of Kunming. In 2016  a mass stabbing at a facility for the mentally disabled in Sagamihara  Japan  left 19 people dead. A year later  three men killed eight people in a vehicle and stabbing attack at London Bridge.\n\nDoreen Lees  an 89-year grandmother from Weldon  said she and her daughter thought they saw one of the suspects when a car came barreling down her street early in the morning Sunday as her daughter was having coffee on her deck. Lees said a man approached them and said he was hurt and needed help.\n\nBut Lees said the man took off and ran after her daughter said she would call for help.\n\n“He wouldn’t show his face. He had a big jacket over his face. We asked his name and he kind of mumbled his name twice and we still couldn’t get it ” she said. “He said his face was injured so bad he couldn’t show it.”\n\nShe said the man was by himself and ""kind of a little wobbly.”\n\n“I followed him a little ways to see if he was going to be OK. My daughter said ‘Don’t follow him  get back here.’”\n\nWeldon residents have identified one of the victims as Wes Petterson. Ruby Works said the 77-year-old widower was like an uncle to her.\n\n“I collapsed and hit the ground. I’ve known him since I was just a little girl ″ she said  describing the moment she heard the news. She said he loved his cats  was proud of his homemade Saskatoon berry jam and frequently helped out his neighbors.\n\n“He didn’t do anything. He didn’t deserve this. He was a good  kind hearted man ″ said Works.\n\nWeldon resident Robert Rush also described the victim as a gentle  widowed man in his 70s.\n\n``He wouldn’t hurt a fly ″ he said.\n\nRush said Petterson’s adult grandson was in the basement at the time and phoned police.\n\nAt the Weldon Christian Tabernacle Church the congregation began their regular Sunday service by saying a special prayer to the victims and their families.\n\nAt the James Smith Cree Nation  a convenience store that also serves as a gas station became a gathering place for community members  who greeted each other with tears and hugs.\n\nA sign on the door said: “Due to safety concerns with our community we will remain closed until further notice.”\n\nThe search for suspects was carried out as fans descended on Regina for a sold out annual Labor Day game between the Canadian Football League’s Saskatchewan Roughriders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers.\n\nThe Regina Police Service said in a news release that with the help of Mounties  it was working on several fronts to locate and arrest the suspects and had “deployed additional resources for public safety throughout the city  including the football game at Mosaic Stadium.″\n\nThe alert first issued by Melfort  Saskatchewan RCMP about 7 a.m. was extended hours later to cover Manitoba and Alberta  as the two suspects remained at large.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Health Authority said multiple patients were being treated at several sites.\n\n“A call for additional staff was issued to respond to the influx of casualties ” authority spokeswoman Anne Linemann said in an email.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement he was “shocked and devastated by the horrific attacks.”\n\n“As Canadians  we mourn with everyone affected by this tragic violence  and with the people of Saskatchewan "" Trudeau said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press journalist Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.']",free real time break news alert

These injuries are not believed to be self inflicted at this point ” said RCMP Commanding Officer Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore  adding they were not sure of the exact cause of death yet.\n\nAsked if Myles Sanderson was responsible for his brother’s death  Blackmore said police are investigating that possibility  but “we can’t say that definitively at this point in time.″\n\nThe discovery of the body came on the second day of a massive manhunt for the pair  who are suspected of carrying out a series of stabbings in an Indigenous community and a nearby town  which also left 18 people injured. It was one of the deadliest attacks in the nation’s history.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAuthorities have said some of the victims were targeted and others appeared to have been chosen at random on the James Smith Cree Nation and in the town of Weldon in Saskatchewan. They have given no motive for the crimes— but senior Indigenous leaders suggested drugs were somehow involved.\n\nJames Smith Cree Nation resident Darryl Burns and his brother  Ivor Wayne Burns  said their sister  Gloria Lydia Burns  was a first responder who was killed while trying responding to a call. Burns said his 62-year-old sister was on a crisis response team.\n\n“She went on a call to a house and she got caught up in the violence ” he said. “She was there to help. She was a hero.”\n\nHe blamed drugs and pointed to the colonization of Indigenous people for the rampant drug and alcohol use on reserves.\n\n“We had a murder suicide here three years ago. My granddaughter and her boyfriend. Last year we had a double homicide. Now this year we have 10 more that have passed away and all because of drugs and alcohol ” Darryl Burns said.\n\nIvor Wayne Burns also blamed drugs for his sister’s death and said the suspect brothers should not be hated.\n\n“We have to forgive them boys ” he said. “When you are doing hard drugs  when you are doing coke  and when you are doing heroin and crystal meth and those things  you are incapable of feeling. You stab somebody and you think it’s funny. You stab them again and you laugh.”\n\nWhile authorities believe Myles is in Regina  about 335 kilometers (210 miles) south of where the stabbings happened  they have issued alerts in Canada’s three vast prairie provinces — which also include Manitoba and Alberta — and contacted U.S. border officials.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith one suspect still at large  fear still gripped communities in the rural  working class area of Saskatchewan surrounded by farmland that were terrorized by the crimes. One witness who said he lost family members described seeing people with bloody wounds scattered throughout the Indigenous reserve.\n\n“No one in this town is ever going to sleep again. They’re going to be terrified to open their door ” said Ruby Works  who also lost someone close to her and is a resident of Weldon  which has a population of about 200 and is home to many retirees.\n\nAs the Labor Day holiday weekend drew to a close Monday  police urged Saskatchewan residents who were returning from trips away to look for suspicious activity around their homes before entering.\n\nArrest warrants have been issued for the pair of suspects and both men faced at least one count each of murder and attempted murder. More charges were expected.\n\nPolice have given few details about the men. Last May  Saskatchewan Crime Stoppers issued a wanted list that included Myles Sanderson  writing that he was “unlawfully at large.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the manhunt continued  police also issued a provincewide alert for suspects in a shooting on the Witchekan Lake First Nation. Officials said the shooting was not believed to be connected to the stabbings  but such alerts are unusual and the fact that a second occurred while authorities were already scouring the Saskatchewan for the stabbing suspects was notable.\n\nThe stabbing attack was among the deadliest mass killings in Canada  where such crimes are less common than in the United States. The deadliest gun rampage in Canadian history happened in 2020  when a man disguised as a police officer shot people in their homes and set fires across the province of Nova Scotia  killing 22 people. In 2019  a man used a van to kill 10 pedestrians in Toronto.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDeadly mass stabbings are rarer than mass shootings  but have happened around the world. In 2014  29 people were slashed and stabbed to death at a train station in China’s southwestern city of Kunming. In 2016  a mass stabbing at a facility for the mentally disabled in Sagamihara  Japan  left 19 people dead. A year later  three men killed eight people in a vehicle and stabbing attack at London Bridge.\n\nPolice in Saskatchewan got their first call about a stabbing at 5:40 a.m. on Sunday  and within minutes heard about several more. In all  dead or wounded people were found at 13 different locations on the sparsely populated reserve and in the town  Blackmore said. James Smith Cree Nation is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from Weldon.\n\nOn Monday  Blackmore said police were still determining the motive  but on Sunday the chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations echoes suggestions the stabbings could be drug-related.\n\n“This is the destruction we face when harmful illegal drugs invade our communities  and we demand all authorities to take direction from the chiefs and councils and their membership to create safer and healthier communities for our people ” said Chief Bobby Cameron.\n\nBlackmore said the criminal record of Myles Sanderson dates back years and includes violence.\n\nThe elected leaders of the three communities that make up the James Smith Cree Nation declared a local state of emergency.\n\nChakastaypasin Chief Calvin Sanderson — who apparently is not related to the suspects — said everyone has been affected by the tragic events.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“They were our relatives  friends ” Sanderson said of the victims. “It’s pretty horrific.”\n\nAmong the 10 killed was Lana Head  who is the former partner of Michael Brett Burns and the mother of their two daughters.\n\n“It’s sick how jail time  drugs and alcohol can destroy many lives ” Burns told the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network. “I’m hurt for all this loss.”\n\nBurns later posted on Facebook that there were dead and wounded people everywhere on the reserve  making it look like “a war zone.”\n\n“The look in their eyes couldn’t express the pain and suffering for all those who were assaulted ” he posted.\n\nWeldon residents have identified one of the dead as Wes Petterson  a retired widower who made he coffee every morning at the senior center. He loved gardening  picking berries  canning  and making jam and cakes  recalled William Works  47  and his mother  Sharon Works  64.\n\n“He would give you the shirt off his back if he could ” William Works said  describing his neighbor as a “gentle old fellow” and “community first.”\n\nSharon Works was baffled: “I don’t understand why they would target someone like him anyway  because he was just a poor  helpless little man  100 pounds soaking wet. And he could hardly breathe because he had asthma and emphysema and everybody cared about him because that’s the way he was. He cared about everybody else. And they cared about him.”\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said the flag above Canada’s parliament building in Ottawa would be flown at half-staff to honor the victims.\n\n“Saskatchewanians and Canadians will do what we always do in times of difficulty and anguish  we will be there for each other ” Trudeau said.\n\n____\n\nGillies reported from Toronto.']",file combination image show press

Canadian police hunt for two suspects following deadly stabbings,https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20220904-canadian-police-hunt-for-two-suspects-following-deadly-stabbings,"['Canadian police hunted for two suspects in a stabbing spree that killed 10 people and wounded at least 15 others mostly in a sparsely populated indigenous community early Sunday.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe stabbings across 13 crime scenes were among the deadliest mass killings in modern Canadian history and certain to reverberate throughout the country  which is unaccustomed to bouts of mass violence more commonly seen in the United States.\n\n""I am shocked and devastated by the horrific attacks today "" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement. ""As Canadians  we mourn with everyone affected by this tragic violence  and with the people of Saskatchewan.""\n\nPolice named the two suspects as Damien Sanderson  31  and Myles Sanderson  30  providing photos and descriptions but no further details about their motive or the victims.\n\nA statement by indigenous leaders indicated the attacks may have been drug related.\n\n""This is the destruction we face when harmful illegal drugs invade our communities "" said Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations. The group represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan.\n\nA mother of two was among the 10 people killed  local media reported  citing the woman\'s former partner.\n\n""It\'s sick how jail time  drugs and alcohol can destroy many lives "" Michael Brett Burns told the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.\n\nIn May  Myles Sanderson was listed as ""unlawfully at large"" by Saskatchewan Crime Stoppers  a program that encourages the public to cooperate with police.

So to speak to a motive would be extremely difficult at this point in time "" Rhonda Blackmore  commanding officer of the Saskatchewan Royal Canadian Mounted Police  told a news conference.\n\nThere may be additional injured victims who transported themselves to various hospitals  police said.\n\nJames Smith Cree Nation is an indigenous community with a population of about 3 400 people largely engaged in farming  hunting and fishing. Weldon is a village of some 200 people.\n\nThe nation\'s elected elders declared a state of emergency ""in response to the numerous murders and assaults on members of the James Smith Cree Nation "" and established two emergency operations centers  the nation said in a statement.\n\nIndigenous people account for less than 5% of Canada\'s population of about 38 million and suffer from higher levels of poverty  unemployment and a lower life expectancy than other Canadians.\n\nTrudeau said his government had been in direct communication with the James Smith Cree Nation leadership  adding  ""we are ready to assist in any way we can.""\n\nThe first stabbings were reported at 5:40 a.m. (1140 GMT) and within three hours police issued a province-wide dangerous persons alert.

Canada stabbing spree suspect dies in custody | Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/7/10-people-killed-in-canadian-stabbing-rampage-identified,['Myles Sanderson died after he was arrested by police for the deaths of 10 people in Saskatchewan stabbing spree.\n\nMyles Sanderson  the second suspect in a deadly stabbing spree in Canada  has died after his car was run off the road  according to police.\n\nThe four-day manhunt had worsened grief and fear in the remote communities where 10 people were killed and more than a dozen others were injured last weekend.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in the province of Saskatchewan said that Sanderson had been found near Rosthern  a town about 130km (80 miles) from the attacks in James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon.\n\nHe went into “medical distress” shortly after his arrest and was taken to hospital in Saskatoon where he was pronounced dead  Saskatchewan RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore said at a press conference.\n\n“The Saskatchewan RCMP has requested the Saskatoon Police Service and the Saskatchewan Incident Response Team to conduct the independent  external investigation into circumstances surrounding the incident ” she said  adding that the police presence in the affected communities would continue.\n\n“Again  I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the families and all those affected and impacted by these events. Our thoughts are with you  and I hope that now you will be able to start healing.”\n\nCanadian media reported earlier that Sanderson’s wounds were self-inflicted after his white truck was run off the road following a high-speed police chase.\n\nSanderson faced three counts of first-degree murder  among other charges  in relation to the fatal attacks that devastated the Indigenous community of James Smith Cree Nation and the nearby village of Weldon.\n\nThe rampage on Sunday marked one of the deadliest incidents of violence in Canada’s history  spurring anguish in the province of Saskatchewan and across the country.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday  authorities released the names of the 10 people killed in the attacks.\n\nMost of the people killed  who ranged in age from 23 to 78  were from James Smith Cree Nation  a First Nation community home to about 1 900 people who live on the reserve  while one was from Weldon. They are:\n\nThomas Burns  23  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nCarol Burns  46  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nGregory Burns  28  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nLydia Gloria Burns  61  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nBonnie Burns  48  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nEarl Burns  66  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nLana Head  49  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nChristian Head  54  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nRobert Sanderson  49  of James Smith Cree Nation\n\nWesley Petterson  78  of Weldon\n\nThe RCMP said the names of the 18 people injured in the attacks would not be released but confirmed that a young teenager was among those hurt. The other injured people are adult men and women  police said.\n\nMark Arcand  whose sister Bonnie Burns and nephew Gregory Burns were killed  said he did not want Bonnie to be remembered as a victim.\n\nHis sister was devoted to her family and “made a difference in people’s lives”  Arcand said during a news conference on Wednesday. “She’s not a victim. She’s a hero ” he said.\n\n“She always put other people before her. That’s what we want people to remember. We want people to remember how she made you laugh  how she told stories at Christmas … at kids’ birthdays  at weddings  at celebrations.”\n\nDays-long search\n\nMyles Sanderson’s brother  Damien Sanderson  was also a suspect and faced a first-degree murder charge  but he was found dead in James Smith Cree Nation on Monday. Police said Damien Sanderson’s body bore injuries “not believed to be self-inflicted”.\n\nJust before police said Myles Sanderson was taken into custody on Wednesday  they issued an emergency alert that said a person “armed with a knife” was travelling in a stolen car in Wakaw  a town about 110km (70 miles) southwest of James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nThe alert “may be related” to the attacks  Saskatchewan RCMP said at that time.\n\nPolice a day earlier had ordered residents of the Indigenous community to shelter in place after they received reports of a “possible sighting” of Myles Sanderson. They later said he was not in the community.\n\nEarlier this week  police also had said Myles Sanderson could be in Regina  the provincial capital  approximately 320km (200 miles) from where the attacks took place.\n\nCANCELLED: Dangerous Persons Alert issued by Melfort RCMP: Myles Sanderson was located and taken into police custody near Rosthern  SK at approximately 3:30 p.m. today. There is no longer a risk to public safety relating to this investigation. Updates to come. ^km — RCMP Saskatchewan (@RCMPSK) September 7  2022\n\nAn Indigenous leader had urged the public to come forward with information about Myles Sanderson’s whereabouts  saying the uncertainty of the days-long search was worsening their plight.\n\n“The uncertainty continues to cause immeasurable stress and panic among our families  friends  and neighbours ” Chief Bobby Cameron of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations  which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan  said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n“They have already gone through enough. We must do everything we can to help end this tragedy without any more loss of life.”\n\nCriminal record\n\nMyles Sanderson had a lengthy criminal record  and many of his crimes occurred when he was intoxicated  Canadian media outlets reported. In May  he was listed as “unlawfully at large” after he stopped meeting with his parole officer following a statutory release from prison.\n\nCiting a Parole Board of Canada document  the Canadian Press also said he had a violence-filled childhood  which led to a “cycle of substance abuse  seeking out negative peers and violent behaviour”. He could be “easily angered when drunk”  the document said.\n\nThe Canadian government has said there will be an independent investigation into the parole decision in Myles Sanderson’s case.\n\n“We’ve got to make sure that the laws work  and in this particular case  obviously [it] led to an indescribably difficult tragedy ” Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n“I do think that coming out of this  there needs to be a hard look across all of our policies and all of our laws. But right now  the most important priority is to be there to support the families.”\n\nFirst Nations University  a First Nations-owned institution in Saskatchewan  said candlelit vigils would be held at its three campuses in the province on Wednesday evening.\n\n“What happened is unfathomable – a beautiful morning darkened by loss. Collectively  we feel the shock  so together  we will mourn  pray  and heal ” President Jacqueline Ottmann said in a statement. “Our hearts are broken  but our will and resolve to survive and move through this trauma  from the unspeakable  is unshaken.”'],myles sanderson die arrested police death people saskatchewan stab spree n nmyles sanderson second suspect deadly stab spree canada die car

Reuters was unable to verify the footage independently.Matt Rodda  a lawmaker who represents Reading in Britain\'s parliament  said the park  located in an historic area of the town  was typically busy on a Saturday evening.""It\'s used by people to sit and meet with friends and obviously at the moment people have been meeting there  observing social distancing  and just chatting to friends peacefully in a park "" Rodda told Sky News.""This incident happened in that kind of environment so it\'s really quite deeply shocking for local people.""Current coronavirus restrictions mean venues like pubs are closed  so many people in Britain gather in parks in the evenings to meet friends.The head of the local council authority in Reading  Jason Brock  said his thoughts were ""with the families of all those who have died or have been injured.""The attack in Reading took place at the site of a Black Lives Matter anti-racism protest in the town earlier on Saturday but police said it was not connected.""There have been some reports that this incident was linked to the Black Lives Matter protest which took place in Reading earlier this afternoon "" Hunter said. ""I can confirm that this incident is not connected. It occurred around three hours after the protest had concluded.""Some 36 people were killed in four attacks in Britain blamed by authorities on terrorism in 2017  the most deadly of which occurred at the end of a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in Manchester  northern England  with other attacks at London Bridge and near parliament.Last year the government downgraded the national terrorism threat level to ""substantial "" meaning an attack is likely  from ""severe.""']",british police sunday say deadly stab spree park southern english town reading treat terrorism incident deputy assistant commissioner dean haydon senior national coordinator counter terrorism police ctp network morning declare incident terrorist incident thames valley police say statement add ctp south east take investigation three people kill another three seriously injured man go stab spree reading saturday witness say man go rampage around gmt forbury garden stab people random gather park sunny summer even reading mile km west london year old man reading arrest suspicion murder police say add search suspect intelligence suggest danger public however urge people remain vigilant report anything suspicious call police detective chief superintendent ian hunter say witness speak bbc lawrence wort say attack begin man suddenly veer toward group eight friend begin stab first three get completely blue get badly wort say assailant lock eye person start come toward ran safety point man turn back attack another group everyone start run scene attacker run park wort say thought affect appal incident read thanks emergency service scene prime minister boris johnson say deeply shock video footage post twitter show paramedic rush help least three people bleed ground reuters unable verify footage independently matt rodda lawmaker represent read britain parliament say park locate historic area town typically busy saturday even used people sit meet friend obviously moment people meet observe social distance chat friend peacefully park rodda tell sky news incident happen kind environment really quite deeply shock local people current coronavirus restriction mean venue like pub close many people britain gather park evening meet friend head local council authority read jason brock say thought family die injured attack reading take place site black live matter anti racism protest town earlier saturday police say connect report incident link black life matter protest take place reading earlier afternoon hunter say confirm incident connect occur around three hour protest conclude people kill four attack britain blamed authority terrorism deadly occur end concert u singer ariana grande manchester northern england attack london bridge near parliament last year government downgrade national terrorism threat level substantial meaning attack likely severe,0.7540362989642992,1

tirelessly to locate and apprehend those responsible.'\n\nDetective Superintendent Nicky Arrowsmith said on Friday: 'Sadly  tonight we have seen a number of needless and completely abhorrent violent altercations  including one that has tragically resulted in a loss of life.\n\n'Officers will be on patrol throughout the night across the South Area Command Unit  with additional resources from the Violent Crime Taskforce and Territorial Support Group deployed to deter and prevent any further violence.'\n\nPolice asked anyone with information that could help officers investigating these

lives at risk - we need this information to help keep London safe.'\n\nThe force said a fatal stabbing of a man in Wisbeach Road  Croydon  at 8.10pm continues to be investigated by homicide detectives

Quadruple homicide (stabbing) at University of Idaho... - LetsRun.com,https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=11629312,"['I think this occurred the same day as the UVA shooting but it seems like that attack is getting all the attention despite less victims and no questions about what happened (witnesses on the bus saw the whole thing play out).\n\nThis Idaho situation is very strange and getting stranger. Moscow  ID has not had a single murder since 2015. This is the first I have read about two other people being in the house at the time of the killings.\n\n- The victims arrived home around 1:45 am  two from a party and two from a bar. Killings occurred between 3:00 am and 4:00 am. 911 call made around 12:00 noon the next day.\n\n- Same knife appears to have been used in all four killings  indicating there was probably only one attacker.\n\n- Two other people sleeping in the house at the time of the killings and when police arrived about eight hours later. 911 call was for an ""unconscious person "" not for a dead person. Police have not said who made the 911 call yet.\n\n- Police originally said there was no further threat to the community but have since rescinded that and say a threat may still exist.\n\n- No sign of forced entry  no murder weapon found. Police have not said whether anything was stolen.\n\nIt\'s strange that the call would be for an ""unconscious person"" rather than a dead person since a knife murder is usually a pretty bloody scene. Police have even stated that there was a lot of blood in the house. If a roommate tried to wake his ""sleeping"" roommate it seems like he would immediately see the blood. As far as people not waking up when the attack was ongoing  remember that Ted Bundy attacked several members of a sorority at Florida State while a few dozen girls were in the house and he was not quiet in his manner of killing that night; his attacks were especially brutal even for him. Nobody noticed him until he was walking out the door.']",think occur day uva shoot seem like attack get attention despite less victim question happen witness bus saw whole thing play n nthis idaho situation strange get strange moscow id single murder since first read two people house time killing n n victim arrive home around two party two bar killing occur call make around noon next day n n knife appear use four killing indicate probably one attacker n n two people sleep house time killing police arrive eight hour later call unconscious person dead person police say make call yet n n police originally say threat community since rescind say threat may still exist n n sign force entry murder weapon find police say whether anything steal n nit strange call would unconscious person rather dead person since knife murder usually pretty bloody scene police even state lot blood house roommate try wake sleeping roommate seem like would immediately see blood far people wake attack ongoing remember ted bundy attacked several member sorority florida state dozen girl house quiet manner kill night attack especially brutal even nobody notice walk door,0.6041176966103176,1
"The wounds can heal, but the pain stays with you.",https://www.vice.com/en/article/nemne8/how-surviving-a-knife-attack-effects-the-rest-of-your-life,['Paul Hayden sat on a chair surrounded by a pool of his own blood while his son  Ricky  lay dying in a hospital bed next to him. The pair had been stabbed several times as they tried to stop a moped being stolen from outside their east London home in the early hours of the day before.\n\nRicky  27  suffered a deep wound to his left thigh that severed a major blood vessel  causing catastrophic bleeding  while Paul  54  was knifed in the arm  hand  leg and foot – the bottom of which was left “hanging off” because it had been “hacked” at so ferociously. At one point  he was told to expect amputation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat night  just over 19 months ago  marked the tragic cutting short of one life and the abrupt dawn of a decline for another. The cruel double blow of enduring the loss of his adored son and surviving such a vicious attack means Paul is unlikely to be the same man who woke up on that ill-fated morning again.\n\n“I wish it was me  not him ” Paul says  visibly distraught as we sit in his living room watching footage of Ricky’s funeral on the television  surrounded by the last vestiges of his son – the urn holding his ashes  old family photos and a glass cabinet displaying treasured keepsakes. “He wanted to do so many things. He worked so hard  never caused us any problems.”\n\nThe scars Paul bears and his withering mobility are constant reminders of the atrocious confrontation. So too is the conspicuous scar that runs across the chest of the family’s dog  Roxy  who was also slashed.\n\nA display cabinet in the family living room preserves treasured memories of Ricky’s life. Photo by Alex Sturrock\n\nAfter spending every night curled up in bed next to her “best mate” Ricky  the staffy now cries for hours on end at his palpable absence. “We were told a few months ago to have her put down because she’s so stressed ” Paul says  while Roxy lies whining at his feet. “They gave us a spray to use to calm her down but she howls. She’s had a really sad face since…”\n\nThe nerve damage and metal plates Paul now has in his right hand mean his dexterity is limited. Even small daily tasks are challenging. “Have you ever tried to hold a toothbrush when you can only get grip from two fingers?” he asks  as he demonstrates that he has to force his fingers to clasp using his other hand. “It cuts your mouth to pieces. Sometimes I can’t even lift the kettle.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul walks with a stick on the occasions he does manage to leave the house and is forced to sit for frequent rest breaks. He has a wheelchair too – but hates using it because  “it feels like they’ve got me”.\n\nWatch: London’s Knife Crime Emergency: ON A KNIFE EDGE\n\nHe drinks morphine “out the bottle”  and takes painkillers  antidepressants and sleeping pills. But the tablets  he says  don’t touch it. At night he lays on the sofa – getting up and down the stairs is too hard – and watches reruns of The Big Bang Theory to stop the thoughts plaguing his mind. He sleeps only for two to three hours  with even these short spells of rest fragmented by panic attacks  vivid nightmares and upsetting flashbacks.\n\nSomeone who’s met dozens of people like Paul is Jo Manson  an ST8 general and vascular surgeon who’s worked in London’s major trauma centres for the past 10 years. She sees the fallout of the nation’s growing knife crime problem  which surged to a record of almost 40 000 offences last year.\n\nGetting patients out of hospital  she explains  “is often the first step in a long journey.” She continues: “The dynamics of how that [stabbing] plays out is part of the emotional burden that goes with the injury. No matter what happens there will always be a scar  a memory  a lifelong association. Even superficial skin wounds that can be fixed with stitches and a couple of weeks of healing will probably lead to a lifetime of memories about the event.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe major trauma centres in the capital specialise in treating severe stabbing injuries  those most “associated with a risk of dying”. “Many require a surgical operation to fix them and what you do to fix it depends on the injury ” Manson says. “We see single injuries to single organs and then we see people who’ve had one blade go through multiple organs.”\n\nSome penetrating trauma patients make it to hospital in an extremely fragile state and surgeons have to adopt a strategy that originates from Navy warship emergency repairs called “damage control”. Essentially  this means stopping the blood loss to keep the patient alive and then coming back to them in 48 hours when they are in a better physiological state to tolerate repair work.\n\nBlood products  including transfusions of plasma  platelets and cryoprecipitate  are usually the first step as soon as people arrive in the emergency room. Severe injury causes a defect in the blood clotting mechanisms  just when the body really needs them most. “Your body lets you down ” Manson explains. “It’s called traumatic coagulopathy.”\n\nAnd if a patient is “actively bleeding” transfusions alone will not help. “You can never fill somebody up if the tap is open on the bath ” Manson says  and explains that surgery is needed to stop the bleeding and restore circulation.\n\nThe decision then to “fix” the damage is not entirely straightforward though. “We need to weigh up the injury burden and the wellness of the patient ” Manson says. “So how much blood they’ve lost  how extensive the tissue damage is  what sort of resuscitation strategy we need to use. It requires not just surgeons  anaesthetists and emergency room doctors but also blood bank staff  porters  intensive care  theatre  radiology and nursing staff. It’s a whole hospital system that’s involved in trying to salvage patients with such severe injuries.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes several operations are required. Manson witnessed an alarming trend where this became the case for multiple patients and for what seemed to be an utterly disturbing reason. “We often see buttock stabbings ” she says  “and these can be deliberate attempts to cause bowel injury. This can need surgical stoma formation (where the bowel is brought out of the abdominal wall and waste diverted into a colostomy bag)  making them a more serious  life-changing event.”\n\nShe makes clear that surgeons only see the results and can’t prove the motives behind stabbings  but hypotheses that the trend came about after young people were exposed to well-intended educational materials designed to explain the horrific consequences of injuries. “I don’t have the evidence but it appeared to become a target because they’d learned that was what happened ” she suggests.\n\nRegardless of where they are on the body and the damage  all wounds caused by sharp instruments  Manson says  are savage. “They require a blow that a perpetrator has to physically deliver in what are likely to be emotionally charged  angry  upset  frightening circumstances.”\n\nWill Flint  28  who was stabbed 12 times in Birmingham in the early hours of New Year’s Day last year when he tried to help a young woman who was being attacked  uses a chilling analogy to describe what that feels like. “It was happening like a sewing machine ” he says  “before I knew it I’d been stabbed. How quickly you can stab someone that amount of times… Bang  bang  bang  bang  and it’s done.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto by Alex Sturrock\n\nThe attack left Will with a punctured lung  severed spleen and diaphragm and lacerated stomach. He needed four hours of emergency surgery and 60 to 80 stitches and staples. Relentless pain and loss of sensation from nerve damage are just some of the complications that will now stay with him for the rest of his life.\n\n“Eventually they told me I’d also lost a lot of function in my left lung and my diaphragm was paralysed so I can’t breathe fully from my left lung ” says Will  who’s developed exercise-induced asthma too as a result. This news was devastating to someone who had a promising fitness career on the cards and had competed internationally.\n\nWill grieved for the loss of the life he’d lived before the stabbing  and experienced depression  PTSD  anxiety and flashbacks. He had counselling and channelled much of the emotional trauma into exercising  writing music  starting a business and talking to close friends. “I had to overcome and accept quite lot ” he says.\n\nHowever  not all victims feel able to talk about the feelings they’re left to grapple with. Max Morgan* was stabbed in the chest  back and legs during a scuffle in north London in 2006 when he was 16. He recovered well physically  but the psychological wounds proved much harder to heal. He says he was in “a pretty bad way” for many years and self medicated by smoking “loads of weed”.\n\n“I’d smoked socially before but it went  almost overnight  from that to smoking every morning a big fat skunk spliff on the way to school  morning break  lunch break  after school ” Max explains. “I did that for four or five years. It removed the ability to think about things so much. But that meant I never came to terms with it and that manifested itself in a very strange sort of paranoia when I was 19 or 20 years old.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe describes feeling as though he was in immediate danger where people around him meant him harm. “I just removed myself ” Max says. “It was a weird sort of agoraphobia. It took a few years for that to drop off. Perhaps I’m still feeling it to this day but it’s not noticeable anymore.”\n\nThe emotional impact on victims can persist for an inconceivable length of time. For Jessica Knight  the mental and physical health implications are something she continues to live with today a decade after she was stabbed in an unprovoked attack in Chorley as a 14-year-old.\n\nHer story is astonishingly stark. She was stabbed 22 times in the arm  neck  stomach  face and back  and left for dead. She spent more than a week in a coma and underwent extensive surgery over a number of months. When she woke from the coma  doctors discovered she’d also suffered a stroke  caused by the profound trauma her body had sustained.\n\nPhoto by Emily Goddard\n\nVisual disturbances  memory problems  persistent nerve pain – which she describes as feeling like plunging yourself into an ice bucket – down the entire left side of her body  sore joints and impaired dexterity have all become part of the fabric of her life.\n\nJessica was diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety. She was also too unwell to take her GCSEs  which flattened her dreams of a career in the creative industries – some of her remarkable paintings and illustrations hang on the walls of her home. But it took years for the realisation of exactly how harmful the attack had been to fully emerge and that triggered a dark period in her life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe attempted suicide twice  the first time when she was 20 and again the year after. Ultimately  she was sectioned and spent two weeks in a psychiatric hospital  where she was on suicide watch. “Everything seemed hopeless ” Jessica says. “I didn’t realise how the attack was going to affect my future. I didn’t even see it coming. I was having mini breakdowns.” She now feels hopeful and has started an interior design course.\n\nJessica explains that she might not be alive now if it weren’t for a passing cyclist who spotted her and called an ambulance. “They said another five minutes and that’s it  no chance. I’d be dead.”\n\nTime is the nemesis for victims of knife attacks. It is the enemy for the medical staff treating them too  Manson says. Surgeons used to talk about the first golden hour and now they have a platinum 10 minutes to deliver treatment to improve the chances of survival.\n\n“Everything is against the clock ” she says. “The speed at which you stop somebody bleeding to death will alter their outcome. The more blood you lose  the more multiple organ dysfunction you get  the more your body has to recover from.”\n\nThat small window  Manson says  is why stellar pre-hospital care from the London Air Ambulance is vital and is perhaps the reason why more critically injured people make it into hospital. Helicopters carry blood and the doctors can perform extraordinary procedures at the roadside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis can include massaging a patient’s heart with their hands  which requires the chest cavity to be opened using a technique called a clamshell thoracotomy – the name makes it easy to visualise how this works. Ambulance crew can also place balloons in the body’s main blood vessel using a technique called REBOA to reduce blood loss in the abdomen. “It sounds quite extreme ” Manson says. “But if patients are effectively dead  but only just  quick intervention can salvage them.”\n\nBut despite best attempts  not every patient can be saved and surgeons have to deliver the shattering  painful news to devastated relatives. Manson remembers every one. “There is a period of reflection  wondering whether we could have done something differently ” she says. “What can we do better next time? Sometimes it is emotional. I’m only human. But for us  life goes on  we have a job to do.”\n\nPhoto by Alex Sturrock\n\nAs our understanding of how the body works and how it can be better fixed continues to advance  the hope is that the job involves less tragedy. Manson is currently conducting research about the innate immune response to traumatic injury at the Barts Centre for Trauma Sciences. “We’re looking at molecular mechanisms  cells and genetics to see if we can unlock the key to multiple organ failure development and make people recover more quickly.”\n\nBut all the hurt caused by knives could be eliminated if people decided against carrying them in the first place. Ricky  Paul  Will  Max and Jessica would not have to bear the indelible etches left on their lives by the appalling attacks if the perpetrators had chosen not to carry a blade.\n\nDanny Corbertt*  14  experienced what he describes as a minor slash on his arm  has had knives pulled on him multiple times and lost one of his friends to a stabbing. He is also currently on tag for carrying – but has now stopped. “I didn’t carry a knife out of no other reason than fear ” he says. “Nowadays it’s never a fist fight. Knives start a cycle of bullshit and it’s hard to get out of it so you carry for fear of your life.”\n\nSo how do you make young people  who are frightened for their lives  give up the weapons they believe are keeping them safe? Will believes multiple elements need to be challenged  including weapons manufacturers and social media  to address the crisis.\n\n“The psychology behind carrying a knife is completely misplaced ” he says. “Take America. They think that everyone having a gun solves gun crime and look what’s happening there. It doesn’t work. The last thing a knife is going to do in any situation is protect you. It’ll cause you to lose the best part of your life  either in prison  in hospital or in a grave.”\n\nWith thanks to Anti-Knife UK and Drop The Knife'],paul hayden sit chair surround pool blood son

Rwanda: 6 people confirmed dead from Kigali explosion,https://rwandinfo.com/eng/rwanda-6-people-confirmed-dead-from-kigali-explosion/,['by Chief Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nKigali – At least 6 people are dead from the large blast that rocked a busy area of Kigali center Wednesday evening � which is going to change the lives of many people who were seriously injured.\n\nPolice arrested 3 people on the scene  and spokesman Eric Kayiranga said Thursday that no new details were available as yet  as investigations continue.\n\nAt about 20minutes to 19:00hours  a large explosion went off as people hurried to go home during the rush hour  according to witnesses working at the Rubangura area. The bomb exploded at the exact spot where taxis headed for Nyamirambo park.\n\nCompared to a similar explosion earlier this year  witnesses say the Wednesday blast was larger  louder and more destructive. No building was affected  but several taxis were damaged. A motorcycle could be seen completely destroyed.\n\nThe RNA reporter who visited the Kigali Central Hospital says he counted 12 people undergoing treatment � some with life-threatening injuries. The injured include two young children aged about 5 or 6 years.\n\nTwo young men were in the intensive care unit undergoing surgery  says our reporter.\n\nAnother victim named Kalisa (27) said he only remembers seeing what he described as a �blue Toyota� vehicle passing by him. The next thing I woke up hospital  narrated Kalisa.\n\nAn unidentified woman lost her eye in the explosion.\n\nDoctors at the Kigali hospital say all the injured will fully recover  but that they need a lot of counseling from the trauma of the explosion.\n\nAll of Thursday  business had returned to normal at the blast area  but what is noticeable is the tightened security.

Chinese power plant explosion kills 21 - World Socialist Web Site,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/08/15/chin-a15.html,['At least 21 people were killed  and five critically injured  by an explosion at a coal-fired power plant in central China last Thursday.\n\nAsia Times reported that the incident occurred when a high-pressure steam pipe exploded at the plant at around 3:20 p.m. The pipe burst and started leaking during testing  according to Xinhua  the state news agency. The cause of the blast has not been immediately determined.\n\nThe plant is currently under construction in the city of Dangyang in Hubei Province. It is owned by the Madian Gangue Power Generation Company  which generates thermal power and sells slag  ash and petroleum products. A spokesman of the Dangyang government propaganda office told the New York Times that an investigation was underway and the government would release more details later.\n\nDu Qiuxin  a villager who lives a kilometre from the plant  told Xinhua: “I was woken up by a loud bang which lasted for several minutes.” The news agency reported that a dozen emergency vehicles were seen at the factory gates and an unspecified number of injured were rushed to hospital.\n\nThe power plant uses coal gangue  also known as low-calorific coal  which is a waste product from the mining and processing of coal. Although coal gangue has relatively low energy value  and is considered more environmentally harmful than other types of coal  some central government officials and provincial governments have pursued approvals for more plants burning the gangue so that it is not left piling up at mine sites.\n\nChina’s industrial disasters are not “accidents ” but involve the systemic sacrifice of the health and safety of workers and residents for profit. The latest blast came a day before the first anniversary of large explosions that killed at least 165 people in the northern port of Tianjin.\n\nThe explosions at the Tianjin facility  which was storing more than 11 000 tonnes of chemicals and hazardous goods  sparked widespread anger over negligence by factory management and the lack of openness by officials about the cause of the disaster and its possible environmental impact. Ten chemical plants were later moved after being found to be too close to residential areas around the city.\n\nAuthorities in February released the findings from an official investigation  which recommended that 123 government employees be punished for offences  including dereliction of duty. Investigators blamed more than 10 government departments for their role in the disaster—from work safety and environmental protection officials  to customs  the police and planners—for failing to supervise and oversee the warehouse. The report also found that legal loopholes and lax implementation of regulations contributed to the catastrophe.\n\nThe State Council investigation was designed to close the matter down  and there has been almost no follow-up in the official media. Local residents  who remain deeply concerned about possible chemical contamination of the area  were forced to start moving back in June when the government stopped contributing financially toward alternative accommodation.\n\nThe authorities are trying to persuade the public and the media that those responsible for the Tianjin disaster have been punished  and that it is now time for everything to return to normal. Huge billboards placed around the vast denuded blast site call on people to unite in the construction of a “bright future” and “not dwell on the past.”\n\nAnger over callous disregard for safety standards  corruption and bureaucratic cover-ups is growing after three decades of economic deregulation and the relentless pursuit of profits that has characterised China’s anarchic economic expansion under capitalist restoration.\n\nIn the wake of the Tianjin report  the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said questions remained over whether China had “really learned lessons from the Tianjin blasts.” While thousands of firms produce and store hazardous chemicals across the country  only six provinces make their information publicly available. Liu Chunlei  the head of Qingyue Environmental Information  said even in those six provinces  the information on the type and amount of chemicals used or stored was not complete. Few provinces made it clear where the potentially dangerous enterprises were located.\n\nIn order to quell deepening popular hostility  the State Administration of Work Safety published new regulations in June requiring companies to devise detailed contingency plans for workplace accidents. The revised measures give more detailed guidance to companies on writing  implementing  publicising and filing contingency plans for workplace accidents. The new rules also hike the penalties for violations.\n\nSubstandard safety practices are the norm  not the exception  and the regulations will change very little. Any disruption to the corporate profits extracted from the Chinese working class would only deepen the economic slump within China and globally.\n\nAccording to the China Labour Bulletin (CLB)  the latest official figures show that there were 28 115 workplace accidents and 16 059 deaths reported in the first seven months of this year. The majority stem from small-scale incidents that never get reported in the official media. In a “fairly typical” month for accidents in May  the CLB listed 11 separate incidents with a total of 16 fatalities. The most common causes of workplace accidents are structural and mechanical failures  particularly during maintenance or repair work  and traffic accidents  such as street cleaners being hit by cars.\n\nMajor explosions  like the one in Dangyang  represent a small proportion of the overall number of accidents. CLB’s Work Accident Map has recorded 37 explosions this year. In January  three people died when blasts swept a fireworks plant in Jiangxi Province. In April  a chemical fire burned for 16 hours in the coastal province of Jiangsu after an explosion at a facility storing chemicals and fuel  requiring 400 firefighters to put it out.\n\nMany of the workers injured or killed in these incidents struggle to get a fraction of the compensation they are entitled to by law. Many poor and vulnerable workers in remote areas in China are lucky to get anything at all  especially if their employer is in league with local government officials who can cover the accidents up.\n\nThe author also recommends:\n\nAnger mounts over government handling of floods in China\n\n[30 July 2016]\n\nChinese Walmart workers engage in wildcat strikes\n\n[8 July 2016]'],least people kill five critically injured explosion coal fire power plant central china last thursday n nasia time report incident occur high pressure steam pipe explode plant around p pipe burst start leak test accord xinhua state news agency cause blast immediately determine n nthe plant currently construction city dangyang hubei province own madian gangue power generation company generate thermal power sell slag ash petroleum product spokesman dangyang government propaganda office tell new york time investigation underway government would release detail later n ndu qiuxin villager live kilometre plant tell xinhua woken loud bang last several minute news agency report dozen emergency vehicle see factory gate unspecified number injure rushed hospital n nthe power plant use coal gangue also know low calorific coal waste product mining process coal although coal gangue relatively low energy value consider environmentally harmful type coal central government official provincial government pursue approval plant burn gangue leave pile mine site n nchinas industrial disaster accident involve systemic sacrifice health safety worker resident profit late blast come day first anniversary large explosion kill least people northern port tianjin n nthe explosion tianjin facility store tonne chemical hazardous good spark widespread anger negligence factory management lack openness official cause disaster possible environmental impact ten chemical plant later move find close residential area around city n nauthorities february release finding official investigation recommend government employee punish offence include dereliction duty investigator blame government department role disasterfrom work safety environmental protection official custom police plannersfor fail supervise oversee warehouse report also find legal loophole lax implementation regulation contribute catastrophe n nthe state council investigation design close matter almost follow official medium local resident remain deeply concerned possible chemical contamination area force start move back june government stop contribute financially toward alternative accommodation n nthe authority try persuade public medium responsible tianjin disaster punish time everything return normal huge billboard place around vast denude blast site call people unite construction bright future dwell past n nanger callous disregard safety standard corruption bureaucratic cover ups grow three decade economic deregulation relentless pursuit profit characterise china anarchic economic expansion capitalist restoration n nin wake tianjin report hong kong base south china morning post say question remain whether china really learned lesson tianjin blast thousand firm produce store hazardous chemical across country six province make information publicly available liu chunlei head qingyue environmental information say even six province information type amount chemical use store complete province make clear potentially dangerous enterprise locate n nin order quell deepen popular hostility state administration work safety publish new regulation june require company devise detailed contingency plan workplace accident revise measure give detailed guidance company write implement publicise file contingency plan workplace accident new rule also hike penalty violation n nsubstandard safety practice norm exception regulation change little disruption corporate profit extract chinese work class would deepen economic slump within china globally n naccording china labour bulletin clb late official figure show workplace accident death report first seven month year majority stem small scale incident never get report official medium fairly typical month accident may clb list separate incident total fatality common cause workplace accident structural mechanical failure particularly maintenance repair work traffic accident street cleaner hit car n nmajor explosion like one dangyang represent small proportion overall number accident clbs work accident map record explosion year january three people die blast sweep firework plant jiangxi province april chemical fire burn hour coastal province jiangsu explosion facility store chemical fuel require firefighter put n nmany worker injure kill incident struggle get fraction compensation entitle law many poor vulnerable worker remote area china lucky get anything especially employer league local government official cover accident n nthe author also recommend n nanger mount government handle flood china n n july n nchinese walmart worker engage wildcat strike n n july,0.7251369791659167,1

Modeling road accident fatalities with underdispersion... | PLOS ONE,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269022,['In 2013  Thailand was ranked second in the world in road accident fatalities (RAFs)  with 36.2 per 100 000 people. During the Songkran festival  which takes place during the traditional Thai New Year in April  the number of road traffic accidents (RTAs) and RAFs are markedly higher than on regular days  but few studies have investigated this issue as an effect of festivity. This study investigated the factors that contribute to RAFs using various count regression models. Data on 20 229 accidents in 2015 were collected from the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation in Thailand. The Poisson and Conway–Maxwell–Poisson (CMP) distributions  and their zero-Inflated (ZI) versions were applied to fit the data. The results showed that RAFs in Thailand follow a count distribution with underdispersion and excessive zeros  which is rare. The ZICMP model marginally outperformed the CMP model  suggesting that having many zeros does not necessarily mean that the ZI model is required. The model choice depends on the question of interest  and a separate set of predictors highlights the distinct aspects of the data. Using ZICMP  road  weather  and environmental factors affected the differences in RAFs among all accidents  whereas month distinguished actual non-fatal accidents and crashes with or without deaths. As expected  actual non-fatal accidents were 2.37 times higher in April than in January. Using CMP  these variables were significant predictors of zeros and frequent deaths in each accident. The RAF average was surprisingly higher in other months than in January  except for April  which was unexpectedly lower. Thai authorities have invested considerable effort and resources to improve road safety during festival weeks to no avail. However  our study results indicate that people’s risk perceptions and public awareness of RAFs are misleading. Therefore  nationwide road safety should instead be advocated by the authorities to raise society’s awareness of everyday personal safety and the safety of others.\n\nData Availability: For data availability  the entire data set is publicly available at the Open Government Data of Thailand ( https://data.go.th/en/dataset/item_71aa612f-adaf-4b0d-b81b-ccdfd97efeef ).

In 2016  Thailand had an estimated rate of 32.7 RAFs and thus ranked eighth among 175 countries and was first in Southeast Asia [2]. Using the RAF prediction model as a function of registered vehicles per capita  the estimate was 30.68 deaths per 100 000 population in 2020 [3]. According to a 2020 report by the World Health Organization (WHO)  these estimates of over 30 deaths per 100 000 people have remained virtually constant over the past decade  serving as evidence against the Thai government’s target for 2021 of 18 deaths as declared in the Road Safety Master Plan (2018–2021) [4]. Thailand seems to be impervious  to the target of 10 deaths in the Decade of Action for Road Safety (2001–2020) or the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of 3 and its associated target of 3.6 in reducing the number of global deaths and injuries from RTAs by 50% by 2020. This is also happening in other countries and thus the declaration of the second Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021–2030 ensues  with the goal of reducing RAFs by at least 50% by 2030 [5].\n\nProblems with the quality of road safety databases are critical in Thailand. The country’s RAFs are particularly vulnerable to underreporting. In 2013  14 056 deaths (20.98 deaths rate) were reported by the Office of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Public Health. This was much lower than the estimated 24 237 deaths (36.2) according to the WHO report. In response  the government emphasized its agenda on road safety issues. The lack of data integration was traced and completed in 2016. The data were managed and collected from three public sectors: (1) the Injury Surveillance System of the Ministry of Public Health (death registration confirmed with medical certification of the cause of death from hospitals); (2) the Police Information System by the Royal Thai Police  Ministry of Interior; and (3) the E-Claim System by Road Accident Victims Protection Company Limited (all claim petitions and compensations related to RTAs nationwide). With these collaborative efforts  the estimates by the WHO in 2016 (22 491 deaths) and the country’s report (21 745 deaths) were nearly synchronized.\n\nIn 2018  the Injury Data Collaboration Center (IDCC)  responsible for the management and maintenance of a national database on road safety  was established [6]. The RAF report for 2011–2020 over 76 provinces and the capital city of Bangkok can be accessed via the IDCC website  https://dip.ddc.moph.go.th/new/. RAFs reported in Thailand are defined for an unlimited period following a crash  not immediately after a crash  or within 30 days after a traffic accident [7].\n\nThe focus is not only on RAFs over the years  but also on the numbers throughout the year  which is critical  particularly during the Songkran festival and New Year holidays. Fig 1 shows the RAFs over the past decade (2011–2020). The RAFs for 2011–2018 involved more than 20 000 deaths per year and over 30 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants  representing approximately 58 deaths per day. During the long seven-day holiday  the number of RAFs rose to approximately 77 and 73 deaths per day during the Songkran festival and New Year holidays  respectively. In addition  real-time monitoring of RAF data over the seven-day deadly festivals shows that more than 80% of victims died after a crash [8]. The lockdown policy for the surveillance  detection  and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2019–2020 appears to have saved lives on the road. The lower number of cars on the roads and reduced traffic volume have been proven to reduce RAFs. Other factors affecting the number of RTAs  RAFs  and road accident injuries (RAIs) must be addressed to improve preventive measures and overcome problems in the long term.\n\nPPT PowerPoint slide\n\nPNG larger image\n\nTIFF original image Download: Fig 1. Number of deaths and death rate (per 100 000 population) on roads in Thailand for the 2011–2020 decade: (above) overall and (below) during the 7-day New Year Celebration and 7-day Songkran Festival  based on IDCC and Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM) reports. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269022.g001\n\nPrevious studies in Thailand have focused on human behavior and demographics rather than road and environmental factors to explain road safety incidences. Over the past two decades  RTAs  RAFs  and RAIs have been dominated by motorcycles  young people  drunk driving  and not wearing a helmet [4 9–13]  suggesting the failure of road safety campaigns and law enforcement. Few studies have considered the road and environmental factors. The number of RTAs increased significantly with a higher volume of rainfall in the southern and northern provinces during the period 2012–2018 [14]. These figures on Thai highways for 2011–2017 were affected by the length of the segment and average annual traffic volume [15]. Road type  road section  and month are crucial factors impacting the number of injuries and fatalities on roads [16 17].\n\nCount regression models for road safety have been reported elsewhere (Table 1). Several studies have estimated the frequency of RTAs  RAFs  or RAIs using traditional Poisson regression  negative binomial (NB) regression  or Conway–Maxwell–Poisson (CMP) regression. The model chosen depends on the assumption of equidispersion. When it is held  standard Poisson regression is simply applied [18]  and a further adjustment with a spatial correlation has recently been presented [19]. In other cases  NB is commonly used to handle the overdispersion problem [20–23] and other versions such as NB-1  NB-2  and Bayesian NB have been developed [24–27]. Alternatively  CMP has recently been adopted to overcome overdispersion [28 29] and underdispersion [30]  although only a few published studies have addressed the latter.\n\nBoth dispersion and excessive zero counts are concerns in count data analyses. Searching in the Elsevier Science Direct database for the period 2018–2022 using the keywords: “excessive zeros and road fatality  road accident or road injury ” 63 studies were identified that dealt with many zero counts and overdispersion problems using zero-inflated models (see for example [31–35]). To the best of our knowledge  no study has analyzed accident data with underdispersion and excessive zeros. Moreover  classifying different injury severity levels is also of interest in road accident studies.\n\nLogistic regression models have been seen in the literature [36–38]  along with a range of machine learning techniques  such as regression trees  random trees  random forests  support vector machines  k-nearest neighbors  and deep neural networks [39–44]. In addition to count data and categorical data  there is considerable interest in the traffic congestion rate. To account for unobserved heterogeneity across observations  the models under Bayesian frameworks have been proposed in studies of pedestrian safety and signalized intersections [45 46]. To deal with sophisticated models  Bayesian methods have been employed to estimate model parameters  such as studies of correlations and heterogeneity in crash rates [47] and for cyclist safety [48].\n\nHowever  the predictive models for death and/or injury are limited to Thailand’s road safety. The present study fills in this gap in research by using count regression models to investigate the distribution of RAFs in Thailand and their potential association with the road and environment at the accident location.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the Methods section  a detailed description of the data source is given  and count regression models and test statistics for dispersion  excessive zeros  and goodness of model fitting are discussed. Model selection with the best performance in identifying key factors is provided in the Results section. The Discussion section interprets the results and compares them with previously reported results. The Conclusion section summarizes the overall study findings in terms of the differences between the death counts and the extra zero death counts  as well as the limitations of the study.'],thailand

Most common workplace accidents and injuries in 2022 | Lluis Law,https://www.lluislaw.com/most-common-workplace-accidents-and-injuries/,['Los Angeles workers are exposed to the most common workplace injuries and accidents. The worst part is that some employers seem unaware of these risks and do not take adequate measures to avoid them.\n\nIf you suffered an injury at your company and need to get compensation from California workers  we can help you. Los Angeles workers compensation lawyers of Lluis Law are specialists in all types of work injuries. We have over 40 years of experience represented and winning cases like yours.\n\nThe most common workplace injuries are events that can occur at any time and in any type of employment. They do not necessarily occur in buildings under construction or in manufacturing factories  accidents also occur in offices and stores.\n\nAfter an accident at work  the worker needs to receive compensation for medical treatment and to cover the expenses incurred. When that happens  workers’ compensation lawyers in California are the key to a successful claim.\n\nWhat are the most common workplace injuries in 2022?\n\nThere are different types of injuries that a worker may experience at his workplace. Here are some of the most common:\n\n1. Traumatic injuries\n\nInjuries are among the most common injuries in people’s lives but also in workplaces. There are certain jobs more prone than others to occupational accidents  so they have a higher incidence of injuries. Examples of these are the construction industry  mining and manufacturing factories.\n\nTrauma injuries are caused by heavy object blows that fall from the heights and hit the worker. Some of the most common workplace injuries are usually serious and can sometimes be disabling. Treatment usually requires expensive exams  surgeries  medicines and long periods of rehabilitation for the worker.\n\n2. Repetitive movement injuries\n\nRepetitive movements also cause very serious long-term injuries to workers. These injuries are very frequent in office workers and employees who need to work long hours with their hands executing an activity.\n\nManufacturing workers  cleaning workers and artisans are also exposed to this type of injury.\n\nOperating a machinery or performing repetitive tasks over and over again causes joint wear. Gradually the muscles and bones deteriorate to the point of causing professional and irreversible diseases.\n\nA typical disease of repetitive work is carpal tunnel syndrome. It causes a lot of pain and weakness in the person and its cure requires a long period of rehabilitation therapy.\n\nCompensation for these most common workplace injuries are sometimes disputed by insurance companies. So if insurance refuses to grant workers compensation benefits in California  do not hesitate to call us at (213) 687-4412.\n\n3. Injuries in traffic accidents\n\nDrivers of transport vehicles (i.e. trucks  buses  taxi drivers) are other candidates for injury at some point in their working life. The injuries left by traffic accidents can also be serious and disabling. Their treatment necessarily requires obtaining compensation from the employer or the responsible person.\n\nIn our section “Common car accident injuries” you can read general information about all types of car injuries.\n\n4. Injuries caused by the use of machinery and equipment\n\nThese injuries are quite frequent in the manufacturing industry and in the construction sector. The injuries caused by these accidents that occur in the workplace are: cuts  lacerations and broken bones. Other more serious can be amputations in any part of the body.\n\nInjuries from the use of machinery and equipment are generally serious and painful. Some of them may leave the worker incapacitated or cause death.\n\n5. Slip and fall injuries\n\nSlips and falls are not exclusive work accidents because anyone can suffer them anywhere. However  they are among the causes of many worker injuries. When floors and stairs do not have adequate and daily maintenance in companies tend to cause such accidents.\n\nThere are different slip and fall injuries: head injuries  spinal injuries and back injuries. Similarly  broken bones (i.e. legs  arms  hands)  sprains.\n\nThe responsibility for these accidents may be of employers and owners of premises that do not properly maintain their work places. These accidents include falls from heights of construction workers and window cleaners.\n\nAmong all the types of occupational injuries that you can suffer this is one of the most common and recurrent.\n\nIn our section on slip and fall lawyers in Los Angeles you will find a lot of information on the topic.\n\nIn Lluis Law we are experts in recovering damages from work injuries and compensation for accidents.\n\n6. Cuts and lacerations\n\nThese injuries are some of the most common in the workplace. Any equipment and sharp office equipment can cause a painful cut to the worker. In companies that use electric saws such as refrigerators and sawmills  workers are likely to suffer these injuries.\n\nThe most common causes of these accidents and injuries are due to poor training  lack of adequate safety protocols. Likewise  not using appropriate protective equipment increases the risk of cuts and lacerations.\n\nEmployers are required to train their employees in safe work routines. They must also ensure that they have safety equipment and apply correct procedures.\n\n7. Overexertion\n\nWorking excessively until exhaustion every day can lead to severe injuries and even death. Excessive effort is considered one of the main causes of workers’ injuries.\n\nCarrying weights constantly as well as lifting  pushing or pulling very heavy equipment or objects causes long-term injuries.\n\nThe most frequent injuries due to overexertion are sprains and strains. Also musculoskeletal disorders in the back. Similarly  excessive intellectual work leads to extreme exhaustion of the person. Then  after a while it can cause a serious illness.\n\n8. Inhalation of toxic gases\n\nWorkers in the chemical industry (oil  perfumery  pharmaceutical) may be at risk of suffering these accidents and injuries. Warehouse workers with chemical deposits (diluents  reagents and more.) may also suffer skin and eye reactions.\n\nIn addition to these reactions  toxic gases can also cause asthma  dermatitis and poisoning. To avoid these injuries it is necessary to wear masks  gloves  glasses and appropriate clothing and other industrial protective equipment.\n\nEmployers are obliged to provide these implements and equipment to their workers. When they do not  they can be sanctioned by the Office of the Labor Commissioner of California.\n\n9. Exposure to loud noises\n\nThe decrease in the ability to listen caused by certain jobs is more frequent than we think. Deafness is caused by permanent exposure to noise in airports  industrial plants  discos  bars and other places.\n\nStrong and permanent noises can lead to progressive hearing loss. If safety measures are not implemented and adequate protective equipment is not used  the result is permanent deafness.\n\n10. Fights at work\n\nWorkplace quarrels are another cause of work injuries. Clashes between workers due to differences in criteria or any other reason generate very dangerous injuries. Such personal injuries range from slips and falls  to broken bones  open and bleeding wounds and even death.\n\nOther causes of accidents are deposits of flammable substances (gas  gasoline  diesel and so on) that can cause burn injuries to workers.\n\nLluis Law’s Los Angeles injury lawyers are constantly representing injury victims as listed above. We have worked on cases with the most common workplace injuries so do not hesitate to contact us so we can help you.\n\nWhat is the number one cause of workplace injuries?\n\nThere are many factors involved when assessing why different types of injuries and accidents occur. However  recklessness and negligence of workers and employers is the main one.\n\nEmployers are required to implement work procedures as safe as possible for the worker. While the worker is in the duty to comply with the company’s safety regulations and perform tasks with common sense.\n\nThe best way to control a hazard is to eliminate it  although there are certain jobs that are dangerous by nature. However  greater control over risks must be sought to reduce the danger of accidents.\n\nRisk factors for accidents and injuries\n\nThe United States Department of Industrial Relations identifies four basic areas as causes of accidents:\n\nType of procedures and tasks. It includes the physical and mental effort of workers in a task  the pace of work and the workload. Another factor is the lack of clear and realistic procedures to execute the tasks. The lack of emergency protocols in companies and the conflicts that arise between labor policy and practice\n\nWork environment. It includes the set of equipment  tools and materials used by the workers  including their design  selection and maintenance. It also covers work areas  distribution of work space  air quality  noise  lighting and temperature.\n\nManagement and organization. The company must have a security program and must promote the safety culture. To do this  you must assign a budget to the area of \u200b\u200bsecurity and responsibility and invest in communication and reporting systems. In addition  perform regular inspection and maintenance work  provide equipment personnel and improve work schedules.\n\nWorkforce factors. This includes the work experience of the worker  his training  stress  fatigue  his attitude and perception of risk. A well-trained worker for a task is less likely to suffer an accident than one who is not.\n\nWhat is a work injury?\n\nAn injury is any alteration or physical damage to any part of the body as a result of a stroke or illness. It is considered as a work injury  that specific damage or occupational disease related to the work performed by the worker. It is called specific because it is the result of a single accident that occurred in the workplace.\n\nIt can also be a long-term physical or mental injury progressively developed by the worker. But it must always be related to the usual tasks performed by the employee.\n\nWhat is considered a work accident?\n\nIt is a sudden fact that occurs within the company and affects the worker while performing a task. It is also considered an accident at work any accident suffered by the worker outside the company during the execution of a task entrusted.\n\nThe condition to be recognized as an accident at work  is that the injury suffered by the worker is on occasion or as a result of a task that is performed for another person.\n\nWhat are good examples of workplace accidents in 2022?\n\nThe types of work injuries are associated with the work performed. Among the common jobs with the highest incidence of accidents with injuries are:\n\nConstruction accidents\n\nFalls from heights. These accidents are quite frequent and occur when working from windows  scaffolding  roofs  stairs and cranes. It includes slips and falls and trips with objects left on the road. Also the wounds with sharp puncture objects like nails left on the floor.\n\nThese accidents are quite frequent and occur when working from windows  scaffolding  roofs  stairs and cranes. It includes slips and falls and trips with objects left on the road. Also the wounds with sharp puncture objects like nails left on the floor. Electrocutions High voltage cables and other unprotected electrical installations constitute a serious risk of electrocution for workers. The slightest contact with energized lines or objects can cause serious and even death by electrocution.\n\nHigh voltage cables and other unprotected electrical installations constitute a serious risk of electrocution for workers. The slightest contact with energized lines or objects can cause serious and even death by electrocution. Objects that fall. Workers who perform tasks on scaffolding in buildings and stairs are exposed to being hit by falling objects. Tools  debris and other objects when falling can cause serious injuries to workers.\n\nIdeally  work under scaffolding with a roof and a protective helmet to avoid injuries. Being hit by a falling object can cause spinal fracture  head trauma and multiple injuries to arms and legs.\n\nGet trapped. Heavy machinery and vehicles on construction sites are dangerous if precautions are not taken. In some accidents involving cranes  dump trucks  tracked machines or backhoes  workers are trapped. When one of these vehicles is overturned  the worker can be crushed or suffer an amputation.\n\nElectrocution / burn accidents\n\nWorkers who repair power lines or install high-voltage equipment can be injured by electrocution. Receiving an electric shock causes burns  cardiac arrest  damage to muscles  nerves and tissues. In many cases electrocution accidents are fatal.\n\nMachine failure accidents\n\nMany accidents are caused by faulty equipment and tools. For example  compressors  motors  hydraulic hoses  conveyor belts. Like nail guns  table saws and drills.\n\nManufacturing accidents\n\nIn manufacturing factories  accidents usually occur with some regularity despite prevention measures. Workers of assembly lines in an industrial plant develop repetitive strain injuries.\n\nSuch injuries affect arms  hands  legs and the hip depending on the task. Other times these are instantaneous accidents in which the worker suffers cuts and lacerations or blows due to carelessness.\n\nOffice accidents\n\nSome of the most common injuries suffered by office workers are from repetitive movements. For example  rotator cuff syndrome or carpal tunnel syndrome\n\nOther common injuries in office accidents are:\n\nSlips and falls  trips.\n\nContinuous or cumulative trauma.\n\nSpinal injuries (herniated discs  neck injuries  back pain).\n\nStress and other psychological diseases.\n\nCar accidents\n\nEmployees who work as drivers in transport companies or any other type of company can suffer traffic accidents. Car accidents involving trucks and buses are usually catastrophic.\n\nCheck our section “Car Accident Lawyers in Los Angeles” for more information and assistance on car accidents.\n\nGardening accidents\n\nAlthough they seem minor accidents they can actually become very serious. Sometimes gardeners can suffer serious injuries. For example: punctures  deep cuts  eye injuries  bumps and falls.\n\nAlso there is a risk due to exposure to certain toxic chemicals (herbicides  weed killers)  electrocution  cervical lesions and tendonitis.\n\nWhat are the most common accidents and injuries of medical workers?\n\nAmong the 18 million workers in the health sector in the United States  these are some of the most common diseases. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  80% of the staff are women.\n\nThese workers have a poorly high rate of occupational diseases than other employees in any other industrial sector. The most frequent injuries among health workers in the United States are:\n\nOverexertion / repetitive stress.\n\nManagement activities of patients that cause muscle damage (manual lifting for example). This can cause sprains  muscle strains and spinal damage.\n\nPunctures and punctures with needles or wounds with other sharp instruments. Including the risk of contagion of diseases and infections (HIV / AIDS  hepatitis B or C  coronavirus).\n\nPhysical and verbal violence by aggressive patients and criminals.\n\nSlips and falls on wet floors that cause bone fractures.\n\nStress and other psychological illnesses due to lack of personnel  prolonged guards and emergency care.\n\nWhat to do to increase control of accidents and injuries?\n\nThere are simple measures that can be taken in addition to the company’s prevention policies to prevent occupational accidents. Some of them can be:\n\nMeet regularly with staff to reiterate the importance of accident and injury control.\n\nPlace notices with tips that highlight what to do to prevent accidents. For example: avoid approaching areas with high voltage cables  deposits of flammable or toxic substances. Use of caution signs “Do not touch”  “Wet floor”  and others.\n\nProvide people with safety equipment to do their job and make sure they are used correctly.\n\nPrepare (if you don’t have it already) information on how to act in case of an industrial accident.\n\nThe control and prevention of occupational accidents can be achieved with a methodical industrial safety policy in the company. The best way to protect workers is to force them to comply with the standards of the Office of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) .\n\nOn the other hand  personnel should be sufficiently trained on the tasks they carry out daily to carry them out safely. Otherwise  the employer incurs faults that can be sanctioned by OSHA.\n\nNow you know a little more about the most common workplace injuries. If you or a loved one was injured at work  you have the right to file a claim and receive workers’ compensation.\n\nThe benefits of hiring a lawyer are really interesting if you consider what you can get in return. The best thing is that the worker does not pay anything initially or if we don’t win the case.

Five dead and 25 injured after gunman opened fire... | Daily Mail Online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11449337/Five-dead-25-injured-gunman-opened-fire-inside-gay-club-Colorado-Springs.html,"['Advertisement\n\nA man who survived a deadly attack at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs Saturday night told how he hid in a dressing room with two other people after shots rang out.\n\nJoshua Thurman  34  told reporters how he had been dancing on the dancefloor at Club Q when he first heard about four or five gunshots.\n\nIn the shooting  five people were killed including two barmen  and 25 were injured before police arrested suspect Anderson Lee Aldrich  who is allegedly the grandson of a MAGA lawmaker who praised the January 6 Capitol riots.\n\nThurman said: \'I thought it was the music because there were no screams  no shouts of ""Help  help "" nothing like that. Then I heard more shots and saw the flash from the muzzle of the gun.\'\n\n\'When I realized what was going on  I ran to the dressing room immediately. There was a customer that followed me  and there was a drag performer  Del Lusional  who was in the dressing room. I made them lock the doors and we got down on the floor and cut out the lights immediately.\'\n\nFrom their hiding spot  Thurman said: \'We heard everything  we heard more shots fired  we heard the assailant be beat up by someone who I assume tackled him  we heard the police come in  we heard them yelling at him  we heard then saying ""Check certain people  \'cause they\'re critical "" we heard everything.\n\n\'And all I can think about is everything — my life  just everything  friends  family  loved ones \' the distraught man said through tears.\n\nBy the time they got out of the dressing room  Thurman said he saw bodies on the ground.\n\n\'There was broken glass  blood — I lost friends!\'\n\nJoshua Thurman  a survivor of the Club Q shooting Saturday night  was seen wiping away tears on Sunday\n\nThurman told reporters on Sunday how he was able to run from the gunman and hide in a dressing room\n\nThurman said he went to the club that night to celebrate his birthday when a gunman entered the gay nightclub many in Colorado Springs\' LGBTQ community considered a home and started firing an unknown number of bullets from his AR-15-style long rifle\n\nThurman said he went to the club Saturday night to celebrate his birthday when a gunman entered the gay nightclub many in Colorado Springs\' LGBTQ community considered \'like a home\' and started firing an unknown number of bullets from his AR-15-style long rifle.\n\nHe was able to kill five people and injure 25 others before he was stopped by two heroic patrons who tackled him to the ground  authorities say.\n\nEarly reports suggest the gunman was wearing bulletproof armor at the time.\n\n\'Their actions clearly saved lives \' Police Chief Adrian Vasquez said at a news conference Sunday morning  noting that another unidentified firearm was found on the scene.\n\nAnderson Lee Aldrich  22  was then arrested at the scene and is now in protective custody at a local hospital for unknown injuries.\n\nThe Colorado Springs man was previously arrested for threatening his mom with a homemade bomb in June 2021  but no formal charges were ever made.\n\nTim Bates  Erric Ramirez  Malissa Ramirez  Trinity Ramirez  and Fred Ramirez deliver flowers to the memorial\n\nA Colorado Springs Community Service officer speaks with Jace Khosla  of Pueblo  Colorado  the morning after a mass shooting at Club Q as he carries flowers to the scene\n\nMichael Robert Travis played taps at the scene of the shooting Saturday night  while his husband  Michael Travis  filmed on his phone\n\nNelly Brusnell signs a cross on the chest of Ivanna Brusnell after placing flowers near a gay nightclub\n\nClothes were still strewn around the street in the aftermath of the shooting at Club Q Sunday morning\n\nA memorial was set up outside the gay nightclub on Sunday  with bouquets of flowers left at the scene\n\nNumerous victims  some in critical condition  were transported to three nearby hospitals following the shooting Saturday night.\n\nThe names of the victims have not yet been released  pending notification of their loved ones. But the deceased is said to have included at least one bartender.\n\nFBI agents are now assisting Colorado Springs police with the investigation to \'determine what federal response is warranted.\'\n\nAuthorities say it is too early to determine if the shooting was a targeted hate crime.\n\nBut the mass shooting has prompted even pro-gun advocate Rep. Lauren Boebert to say: \'This lawless violence needs to end and end quickly.\'\n\nFive people have died after a gunman opened fire inside a gay nightclub in Colorado last night\n\nColorado Springs police say Anderson Lee Aldrich entered Club Q just before midnight and fired an unknown amount of bullets from his long rifle before he was stopped by at least two \'heroic\' patrons who tackled him to the ground\n\nAuthorities say Aldrich had used a long rifle in the massacre  and another firearm was found at the scene\n\nOn its Facebook page  a statement from Club Q said it was \'devastated by the senseless attack on our community\'\n\nColorado Springs police received initial reports of an active shooting at the club around 11.57pm Saturday night.\n\nThe first officers arrived on the scene within three minutes of the call  and Anderson was detained at 12.02am.\n\nImages from the scene showed multiple security and emergency vehicles with flashing blinkers parked on a street near the venue.\n\nMore than 30 firefighters and 11 ambulances responded to the scene  according to the Colorado Sun\n\nClothes were seen strewn along the street Sunday morning  as police continued to scour the site for any evidence. Homicide investigators will remain at the scene for \'many  many hours.\'\n\nPolice did not give any information on the motivation behind the attack.\n\nNorth Academy Boulevard between North Carefree Circle and Village Seven Road will remain closed while officials search the scene. Residents are advised to avoid the area.\n\nAnyone who witnessed the shooting or has video footage of the attack is also asked to contact the police.\n\nAuthorities remained on the scene of the shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs into Sunday morning\n\nAt least 25 people were injured after shots were fired inside Club Q (pictured Saturday night) in Colorado Springs just before midnight  a police spokesperson has confirmed\n\nImages from the scene showed multiple security and emergency vehicles with flashing blinkers parked on a street near the venue\n\nHomicide investigators will remain at the scene for \'many  many hours\' as authorities work to process the scene. The police did not give any information on the motivation behind the attack or the type of gun used\n\nNorth Academy Boulevard between North Carefree Circle and Village Seven Road will remain closed while officials search the scene. Residents are advised to avoid the area\n\nThe FBI Denver office confirmed on Twitter Sunday morning that they are assisting Colorado Springs police in the investigation\n\nThe shooting comes one year after a 21-year-old man named Anderson Lee Aldrich was arrested for making a bomb threat in Colorado Springs.\n\nA woman told police at the time that her son had a homemade bomb  multiple weapons  and ammunition.\n\nNearly 10 homes were evacuated in the aftermath  KRDO reported at the time  but no bombs were found at the scene.\n\nAuthorities said at the time that he initially refused to comply with the deputy\'s demands to surrender  but following a one-hour standoff he backed down.\n\nAldrich was booked into the El Paso County Jail facing two counts of felony menacing and three counts of first-degree kidnapping.\n\nBut Aldrich was never formally charged in the threat  and the case was sealed.\n\nLeslie Bowman told the New York Times that the terrifying incident took place at her home  where she had been renting a spare room to Aldrich\'s mother  Laura Voepel. She believed Aldrich was living with his grandparents nearby at the time.\n\nShe said she was not home at the time  but received a call from Voepel that said ""Don\'t come home right now  there are some people looking for Andy.""\n\nBowman kicked Voepel out of the home two days later and had not seen her since. But  she said  about one month ago  police stopped by her house looking for Voepel for a welfare check.\n\nBowman now says she remembers Aldric having an \'aggressive side\' saying he once slammed the door in her face when his mother was upset about a repair in her bathroom.\n\nFollowing the shooting on Saturday  Bowman wondered why Aldrich was never imprisoned following the threat  noting: \'After that initial day  police never reached out to me for additional information.\n\n\'I\'m a Second Amendment supporter  don\'t get me wrong \' Bowman told the Times. \'But for him to be out there and have access to weapons after that incident  I don\'t understand it.\'\n\nClub Q describes itself as an \'adult-oriented gay and lesbian nightclub hosting theme nights such as karaoke  drag shows & DJs\'\n\nThe club was hosting a drag show earlier in the night  and was scheduled to stay open until 2am\n\nFrequent clubgoers took to Facebook to express their shock at the shooting\n\nClub Q describes itself online as an \'adult-oriented gay and lesbian nightclub hosting theme nights such as karaoke  drag shows & DJs.\'\n\nHow Colorado went from the \'hate state\' to electing a gay governor Jared Polis became Colorado\'s first openly gay governor in 2018 Colorado was once known as \'The Hate State\' after voters in 1992 passed a ballot proposition that banned anti-discrimination ordinances. But in the years since  the Centennial State has become a beacon of gay rights. It formally recognized same-sex marriage in 2014 — one year before the Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. And four years later  Colorado elected its first openly gay governor  Jared Polis. He is just the second openly LGBTQ individual to be elected governor of a state in the US  after Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon  a Democrat who identifies as bisexual  was first elected in a special election in 2016. Polis said during his run in 2018 he found Colorado voters to be more concerned about kitchen-table issues than his sexuality. But he also used his platform to advocate for LGBTQ rights  signing into law a ban on the use of therapy that seeks to change minors’ sexual orientation or gender identity in 2019. He also approved a measure allowing transgender people to update their gender on their birth certificates and other documents just one year after taking office. \'Today Colorado took an important step forward in recognizing our diversity as a strength \' Polis told NBC News in an emailed statement at the time. \'These bills truly underscore the idea that Colorado is a state where everyone can be their true selves and live the life they want.\' Now  Polis is a vocal critic against the rise of attacks on the LGBTQ community in recent years. \'Look  words matter. Laws matter. When a group of people  LGBTQ youth  feel targeted by the words and laws that some politicians espouse  of course  it can increase anxiety  depression \' the governor said in an interview with CNN earlier this year.

My Colorado Springs Drag sisters.\n\n\'I cannot believe this is happening in a place we call a safe space we had that taken from us tonight. My heart is shattered \' Carzsa Maestas wrote.\n\n\'Club Q is where I started my Drag career. It’s my home bar. This is absolutely beyond devastating and I pray to God that everyone there tonight is OK.\'\n\nSurvivors of the rampage have described the bloody scene Aldrich apparently left in his wake.\n\nMichael Anderson  25  told the Mirror how he was working at the bar when he first heard the gunshots.\n\n\'I saw a person with a gun  and I immediately ducked behind the bar  and glass was flying around me \' he said.\n\nAnderson then escaped to the outdoor patio  where he found somewhere to hide and hunkered down with two clubgoers. From there  he said  they watched a group flee through a door they had managed to pry open.\n\n\'I was afraid I was going to die \' he said. \'I was prepared to get shot when the shots stopped.\n\n\'After a minute or two  I wasn\'t sure if it was over or not so I got up and decided to make a run for it.\'\n\nAs he ran  Anderson said he saw a man lying on the ground with a potentially fatal neck injury  and when he got inside  he said  he saw \'two people had seemingly detained someone on the ground and were kicking them and yelling at them.\n\nHe then ran behind the bar to grab his belongings before fleeing to his car.\n\n\'The cops arrived in mass numbers by this time \' Anderson said. \'I told them I believed the shooter was down on the dance floor and the shots had stopped.\n\nHe said he is now praying for the people at the hospital  but said: \'Our community is strong and remains united.\n\n\'We ask for your prayers and support.\'\n\nAngelo Patino  18  meanwhile  performed a drag show at the club Saturday night but left about half an hour before the shooting.\n\n\'I am in shock \' he told the New York Times  noting the club \'was my safe space.\'\n\n\'It hurts me that I could not protect my friends when they needed it \' he said.\n\nAnother man who had left the club just 10 minutes before the shots were fired also told KRDO how he was able to connect with one of his friends who was shot at the hospital.\n\nHe told the news station that his friend described the shooter as a man wearing a mask and a bulletproof vest.\n\nAnother of his friends  though  was killed in the massacre.\n\n\'It\'s hard to hear  it\'s hard to see \' the man  only identified as Joseph  told KRDO. \'These people at the bar  they\'re friends  they\'re family.\'\n\nAll Souls Unitarian Church will be holding a gathering at noon  local time  on Sunday  while Temple Beit Torah is hosting a Trans Day of Remembrance service.\n\nFormer employee Greg Resha  also known as Kyree Myst  has also set up a GoFundMe to help pay for the victim\'s medical and funeral expenses.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon  more than $3 100 had already been raised for the victims.\n\nAlthough the motive behind last night\'s shooting was not immediately known  the tragedy brought back memories of the 2016 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando  Florida  that killed 49 people.\n\nGunman Omar Mateen was killed on the scene after his gun jammed.\n\nHow America\'s gay clubs and bars have been targeted in hate attacks Saturday\'s shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs is just the most recent attack targeting gay clubs in America\'s history. In 1973  32 people died in an arson attack at the UpStairs Lounge  a gay bar in the French Quarter in New Orleans. The arsonist was never arrested. On November 18  1980 a gunman killed two men in front of two gay venues in New York City’s West Village. A former transit police officer  who was also a minister’s son  fired a submachine gun indiscriminately at men standing in front of the Ramrod  a popular leather bar  and the Sneakers bar on West Street. In 1997  an explosion injured five people at a gay bar in Atlanta. Eric R. Rudolph  a right-wing extremist  claimed responsibility for that and a series of other bombings. In 2000  a former Marine who said that he was on a mission to kill gay people  shot and killed a man and injured six others in Roanoke  Virginia In 2016  a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at Pulse  a crowded gay nightclub in Orlando  Florida in the second deadliest mass shooting in American history.

The gunman was fatally shot by police officers after he fired at them  authorities said at the time.\n\nGov. Jared Polis took to Twitter Sunday morning  calling the shooting \'horrific  sickening and devastating.\'\n\n\'My heart breaks for the family and friends of those lost  injured  and traumatized in this terrible shooting \' the Colorado governor said  noting that he spoke with Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers \'and clarified that every state resource is available to local law enforcement in Colorado Springs.\n\n\'We are eternally grateful for the brave individuals who blocked the gunman  likely saving lives in the process  and for the first responders who responded swiftly to this horrific shooting.\n\n\'Colorado stands with our LGBTQ community and everyone impacted by this tragedy as we mourn.\'\n\nUS Representative-elect Eric Sorensen also expressed his support for the victims and call on Americans to \'turn down hateful rhetoric aimed at our LGBTQ community.\'\n\nMr Sorensen said: \'Devastating news in Colorado Springs where 23 people were shot at an LGBTQ club overnight  according to Police. As we pray for those fighting for life  we must use loud voices to stand up against hate.\'\n\nSen. John Hickenlooper  a Colorado Democrat  also called the shooting \'an unspeakable act.\'\n\nHe added: \'We have to protect LGBTQ lives from this hate.\'\n\nAnd Rep. Lauren Boebert  a local Republican who is an outspoken supporter of gun rights  called the shooting \'absolutely awful\' and said she was praying for the victims.\n\nShe added: \'This lawless violence needs to end and end quickly.\'\n\nPresident Joe Biden also called for a renewed weapons ban on Twitter.\n\n\'Jill and I are praying for the families of the five people killed in Colorado Springs  and for those injured in this senseless attack.\n\n\'While no motive in this attack is yet clear  we know that gun violence has a particular impact on LGBTQI+ communities across our nation.\n\n\'We must address the public health epidemic of gun violence in all forms \' the president continued. \'I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly three decades  but we must do more.\n\n\'And we must drive out the inequities that contribute to violence against LGBTQI+ people. We cannot tolerate hate.\'\n\nMeanwhile  in Illinois  House Majority Leader Greg Harris said: \'Today is Trans Day of Remembrance  when we honor the memories of our murdered Trans siblings. Sadly we also grieve for people shot in an attack on an LGBT club in Colorado Springs last night.\n\n\'Honor their memories by fighting back against hate and defending Trans rights.\'\n\nDemocrat Stephen Heidt  who recently lost his bid for Idaho governor  echoed their claims  saying: \'Our family is praying for all those affected by the Colorado Springs Shooting.\n\n\'We have yet another gun crime  another hate crime. We must come together as a nation and stand against hate now. We are out of time.\n\nAnd in New York  Gov. Kathy Hochul also released a statement  reading: \'I am horrified by the shooting in Colorado Springs  and my heart breaks for the victims and their loved ones.\n\n\'This senseless loss of life is yet another tragedy due to gun violence and hate  and I join all New Yorkers in praying for the people of Colorado.\'\n\nPresident of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola also issued her condolences to the victims and their loved ones.\n\n\'My heart breaks at another deadly attack targeting the #LGBTIQ community-this time at a club in #ColoradoSprings in the US \' she tweeted.\n\n\'It\'s another reminder of our duty to lead the fight against hate and ensure everyone is free to love who they wish to love & live as they wish to live.\'']",advertisement n na man survive deadly attack gay

Chesapeake Walmart shooting: Six victims shot and killed in a Virginia ...,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/us/chesapeake-virginia-walmart-shooting/index.html,['CNN —\n\nAuthorities have identified five of the six people who were killed in a Virginia Walmart after the store’s manager began firing Tuesday night before killing himself.\n\nFive of the deceased victims were identified as Lorenzo Gamble; Brian Pendleton; Kellie Pyle; Randall Blevins; and Tyneka Johnson  according to a Wednesday news release from the City of Chesapeake.\n\nThe sixth deceased victim was a 16-year-old boy who authorities are not naming because he was a minor  the city said.\n\nAll six victims were employed by Walmart  a company spokesperson told CNN.\n\n“The City of Chesapeake has always been known as the ‘City That Cares’ and now  more than ever  we know our City will show up and care for those who need it most ” the release said. “Please join us in praying for the family and friends of these community members who we have lost.”\n\n(From top left) Lorenzo Gamble  Kellie Pyle  Brian Pendleton  Tyneka Johnson and Randy Blevins Family Handout\n\nEarlier Wednesday  the city identified the shooter as 31-year-old Andre Bing  saying he was “armed with one handgun and had multiple magazines on his person.”\n\nBing was an “overnight team lead” and had been employed with Walmart since 2010  the company said in a statement.\n\nAuthorities were digging into the shooter’s background Wednesday for information on what could have motivated the attack  police said.\n\n“Law enforcement will do what they can and I promise you  more information will follow ” Chesapeake Mayor Rick West said in a video message posted Wednesday evening.\n\nThe violence marks yet another mass shooting in a place traditionally seen as safe – from schools to hospitals to stores.\n\nJust 170 miles west of Chesapeake  a 22-year-old student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville allegedly opened fire on fellow students this month  killing three of them on a bus returning to campus from a field trip to Washington  DC.\n\nLast weekend  a 22-year-old shot and killed five people at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs  Colorado  and 19 others were injured  authorities said.\n\nThe US has suffered more than 600 mass shootings so far this year  according to the Gun Violence Archive. Both the non-profit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot  not including the assailant.\n\nManager came in and ‘just started spraying’\n\nAt least 50 people were inside the Walmart when the violence erupted  police said. Some of them have begun publicly sharing their accounts of how a calm night turned into a horrifying tragedy.\n\nThe deadly rampage started around 10:12 p.m. Tuesday  less than an hour before the Walmart Supercenter was set to close.\n\nThe first officer arrived on scene within two minutes and officers entered the store roughly two minutes after that  at about 10:16 p.m.  police said.\n\nEmployee Kevin Harper said a colleague entered the breakroom and started shooting.\n\n“I just left out the breakroom … (the gunman) starts cappin’ people up in there ” Harper said in a Facebook Live video. The video is no longer on his Facebook page  but it has been re-shared on social media.\n\n“He came in there and just started spraying ” Harper said.\n\nAt least six more people were transported to local hospitals for treatment  one of whom remained in critical condition Wednesday  city officials said. Authorities were also working to determine whether there were any additional injuries that were self-reported.\n\nJalon Jones  24  was shot several times by the gunman Tuesday  his mother  Kimberly Shupe  told CNN affiliate WTKR. Shupe addressed reporters Wednesday outside the hospital where her son was in the intensive care unit in stable condition.\n\n“Three individuals  including the shooter  were located deceased in the break room of the store ” the city of Chesapeake tweeted. “One victim was located deceased toward the front of the store. Three other victims were transported to local hospitals for further treatment  but succumbed to their injuries.”\n\nCustomer Jeromy Basham  who was at the Walmart Tuesday night to buy tablecloths  said he heard the sound of the gunshots and a few seconds later  people began rushing out of the store.\n\n“It sounded loud as s**t but it was so many of the same kind of sound I don’t know what the hell else it could have been ” he said in a video uploaded to his Facebook page.\n\nFor a while  Basham took cover after employees warned him  “Don’t come out ” before he eventually made it outside safely.\n\nOnce outside  he saw responding officers enter the store with heavy body armor and long rifles while other witnesses and employees stood in the parking lot. In additional videos from Basham  dozens of first responders are seen on the scene.\n\n‘This one is especially painful’\n\nJoetta Jeffery said her mother  Betsy Umphlett  sent her texts from inside the store saying bullets were flying.\n\n“I’m crying  I’m shaking ” Jeffery told CNN. “I had just talked to her about buying turkeys for Thanksgiving  then this text came in.”\n\nOn Wednesday  police continued processing the scene of a mass shooting Tuesday night that killed six people at a Walmart in Chesapeake  Virginia. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nJeffery said her mother is not injured  but traumatized by the tragedy.\n\nA reunification center was set up at the Chesapeake Conference Center for families seeking details about loved ones who were at the store. City officials have asked that only relatives or emergency contacts of those inside visit the center.\n\nJohn Furner  Walmart US’ president and CEO  said the mass shooting in Chesapeake was exceptionally tragic because the assailant was an employee.\n\n“We feel tragedies like this personally and deeply.

Updates: Sources confirm identity of Walmart employee who killed 6 ...,https://news.yahoo.com/multiple-fatalities-injuries-reported-shooting-045600345.html,['Seven people died in a shooting inside a Chesapeake Walmart late Tuesday night when a store employee opened fire with a pistol  starting in the break room  the police chief said.\n\nThe shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot  Chief Mark Solesky confirmed Wednesday. The man’s name has not been released because next of kin have not been notified  Solesky said.\n\nBut two sources with knowledge of the investigation confirmed Wednesday the shooter is Andre Bing. Police were stationed Wednesday morning outside the Chesapeake home that property records said Bing purchased in 2019.\n\nThe Walmart is on Sam’s Circle  off North Battlefield Boulevard and just off I-64. The store will be closed while the investigation is ongoing.\n\nSix victims have died  and five are being treated at area hospitals. Late Tuesday night they were at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital  confirmed Mike Kafka  a spokesman for Sentara Healthcare. Their names have not been released  and Kafka could not provide their condition.\n\nThe first report to police came in at 10:12 p.m. Tuesday. Police were on scene by 10:14 p.m.  Solesky said. The building was declared safe by 11:20 p.m.\n\nInvestigators are not aware of anything in the shooter’s background that would have indicated cause for concern. Asked if the shooter was known to police  Solesky said  “Not that I’m aware of at this time.”\n\nGrief was on display outside both the hospital and a family reunification center set up in Chesapeake.\n\nJust after 2 a.m.  a man was escorted out of the emergency room after he erupted in emotion  wailing and shouting. “They killed my brother ” he yelled as he ran away.\n\nShrieks cut through the air as a group of people left the reunification site at the Chesapeake Conference Center  illuminated by the flashing blue lights of a Chesapeake police car.\n\nGathered with others outside the Sam’s Club on the other end of the shopping center  Walmart worker Joseph Strempski said he was in the maintenance closet when he heard the gunfire. He then saw people running and ran with them.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a 30-minute time span  police from across multiple agencies responded in force. FBI agents could be seen at the scene  and ATF agents had been en route.\n\n“As police arrived on scene  they realized it was an active shooter situation and we had to change our tactics ” said police spokesman Leo Kosinski during a briefing Tuesday night.\n\nWalmart issued a statement via Twitter expressing shock.\n\n“We’re praying for those impacted  the community and our associates ” the company said. “We’re working closely with law enforcement  and we are focused on supporting our associates.”\n\nThe Chesapeake Conference Center reunification site was meant for immediate family members or the emergency contact of anyone who may have been in the building.\n\nAmong those gathered outside very early Wednesday morning was Camille Buggs  a former Walmart employee. She said she came to the conference center to try and find some information about some of her former coworkers  whom she still considers family but had not been able to reach since the shooting.\n\n“You always say you don’t think it would happen in your town  in your neighborhood  in your store — in your favorite store and that’s the thing that has me shocked ” said Buggs  58  of Chesapeake.\n\nBuggs  who now works at nearby Greenbrier Mall  said she and her current coworkers would typically stop by the Walmart on their way home for snacks or food. But they opted not to Tuesday night  thinking about the long work week still ahead. It was only once she got home that she heard the news.\n\nLocal politicians shared reactions on Twitter to the deadly shooting.\n\n“I am absolutely heartbroken that America’s latest mass shooting took place in a Walmart in my district in Chesapeake  Virginia tonight. I will not rest until we find the solutions to end this gun violence epidemic in our country that has taken so many lives ” said state Sen. Louise Lucas  a Democrat.\n\n“Enough is enough ” said U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria  a Democrat representing the 2nd District.\n\nChesapeake Mayor Rick West called for prayers for the victims  their loved ones and their coworkers  and expressed gratitude for the quick action by first responders.\n\n“I am devastated by the senseless act of violence that took place late last night in our City ” West said in a statement. “Chesapeake is a tightknit community and we are all shaken by this news.

Rwanda killings spark anger among Ugandans | Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/rwanda-killings-spark-anger-among-ugandans-1870884,['Local leaders in the Ugandan districts bordering Rwanda have condemned the continued shooting of Ugandans inside Rwanda by Rwandan forces.\n\nThe leaders said they are disappointed that the killings have persisted despite the ongoing implementation of the memorandum of understanding signed between President Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame in August last year in Luanda  Angola.\n\nOn August 21 last year  the Ugandan presidential press secretary  Ms Linda Nabusayi  said during the meeting in Angola  the two leaders committed to refrain from actions that are capable of causing destabilisation or subversion in each other’s territory and also eliminate all factors that may create such perception and financing  training and infiltration of destabilising forces.\n\nShe added that the pact indicated that the two countries would resume cross-border activities  including movement of persons and goods.\n\nMr Patrick Besigye Keihwa  the Kabale District chairperson  and his Kisoro counterpart  Mr Abel Bizimana  yesterday said the shooting is a serious provocation that might result in acts of revenge on Rwandans living on the Ugandan side.\n\nA Ugandan  Teojen Ndagijimana  aged 26  was shot dead on Saturday night by Rwandan security forces in Kumugu Trading Centre in Musanze District inside Rwanda  about three kilometres from the Uganda border.\n\nHe is the fourth Ugandan to be shot dead inside Rwanda by Rwandan forces since the Kigali government closed its border with Uganda at Katuna in February last year  stopping movement of goods and people from either country.\n\nRwanda declared Uganda a hostile country. Other Ugandans who have been shot dead by Rwandan forces are Alex Nyesiga  32  who was killed in May last year together with a Rwandan national as they entered Rwanda from Uganda.\n\nOn November 9  two other Ugandans Job Ebyarishanga and Bosco Tuheirwe  both residents of Rukiga District near the border  were shot dead about 1km inside Rwanda. Rwanda police later claimed the deceased were smuggling raw tobacco into the country.\n\n“Shooting and killing Ugandans suspected of smuggling in Rwanda is against human rights because there are other options that the Rwandan security operatives can use to discipline foreigners that commit offences in their country. Such trigger-hungry actions may lead our people to revenge because of such extrajudicial killings ” Mr Bizimana said.\n\n“Presidents Museveni and Kagame came to power when the people in the two countries were living in harmony and it is their duty to undo anything that went wrong as soon as possible for the good of the people in the two countries ” he added.\n\nMr Keihwa said whereas no single Rwandan has been killed in Uganda since their country issued a directive stopping them from crossing into Uganda  when Ugandans continue being shot dead in Rwanda  they may be provoked into retaliatory action.\n\n“Nobody should test the patience of Ugandans that have lost their relatives and friends in Rwanda shooting since last year. I condemn in totality the shooting and killing of Ugandans in Rwanda. Respecting people’s lives is very important  especially when there are other options such as courts of law where suspects are charged with the offences committed  but not extrajudicial killings. The presidents of the two countries should do their best to resolve any outstanding issues for the good of the people in either country ” Mr Keihwa said.\n\nRwanda’s response\n\nWhen contacted for a comment on the increasing frequency of shooting Ugandans in Rwanda yesterday  the Rwandan ambassador to Uganda  Maj Gen Frank Mugambage  said: “Talks are going on. Leave it at that.”\n\nMr Peter Mugisha  the Kisoro Resident District Commissioner  said they held a district security committee yesterday and discussed the shooting of Ndagijimana  adding that they were waiting for a response from the Ugandan Foreign Affairs ministry about when the body would be brought home.'],local leader ugandan district border rwanda condemn continued shoot ugandan inside rwanda rwandan force n nthe leader say disappointed killing persist despite ongoing implementation memorandum understand sign president museveni rwandan counterpart paul kagame august last year luanda angola n non august last year ugandan presidential press secretary m linda nabusayi say meeting angola two leader commit refrain action capable cause destabilisation subversion others territory also eliminate factor may create perception finance train infiltration destabilise force n nshe add pact indicate two country would resume cross border activity include movement person good n nmr patrick besigye keihwa kabale district chairperson kisoro counterpart mr abel bizimana yesterday say shoot serious provocation might result act revenge rwandan live ugandan side n na ugandan teojen ndagijimana age shot dead saturday night rwandan security force kumugu trading centre musanze district inside rwanda three kilometre uganda border n nhe fourth ugandan shot dead inside rwanda rwandan force since kigali government close border uganda katuna february last year stop movement good people either country n nrwanda declare uganda hostile country ugandan shoot dead rwandan force alex nyesiga kill may last year together rwandan national entered rwanda uganda n non november two ugandan job ebyarishanga bosco tuheirwe resident rukiga district near border shot dead km inside rwanda rwanda police later claim decease smuggle raw tobacco country n nshooting kill ugandan suspect smuggle rwanda human right option rwandan security operative use discipline foreigner commit offence country trigger hungry action may lead people revenge extrajudicial killing mr bizimana say n npresidents museveni kagame come power people two country live harmony duty undo anything go wrong soon possible good people two country add n nmr keihwa say whereas single rwandan kill uganda since country issue directive stop cross uganda ugandan continue shoot dead rwanda may provoke retaliatory action n nnobody test patience ugandan lose relative friend rwanda shoot since last year condemn totality shoot kill ugandans rwanda respect people live important especially option court law suspect charge offence commit extrajudicial killing president two country best resolve outstanding issue good people either country mr keihwa say n nrwandas response n nwhen contact comment increase frequency shoot ugandan rwanda yesterday rwandan ambassador uganda maj gen frank mugambage say talk go leave n nmr peter mugisha kisoro resident district commissioner say hold district security committee yesterday discuss shoot ndagijimana add wait response ugandan foreign affair ministry body would bring home,0.7523128699711651,1

The Cumbre Vieja erupted in La Palma on Sunday  following several earthquakes over the weekend  creating two fissures within the volcano. The fast-moving lava has already destroyed homes and buildings in its path  with the lava nearly 20 feet high in some areas. Local officials say no injuries have been reported so far. This is the archipelago\'s first eruption in 50 years. Experts say it could last for weeks or even months.\n\nRussian police have arrested an 18-year-old student in connection with a school shooting that killed six people. Officials say the suspect entered the campus of Perm State University  about 800 miles east of Moscow Monday morning. He began shooting as teachers and students locked themselves in classrooms while others jumped out of windows to safety. Nearly 30 people were injured in the attack  including the shooter.\n\nReuters reports the suspect is a student at the university and bought the hunting rifle he used back in May. The attack comes just four months after another school shooting killed nine people. Russia raised the minimum age to buy firearms from 18 to 21 after that shooting  but the new law has not gone into effect yet.\n\nAnd the man who inspired the film ""Hotel Rwanda"" has been found guilty for being part of a terror group. A Kigali judge convicted Paul Rusesabagina and 20 others for forming an illegally armed group that conspired to attack Rwanda in 2018 and 2019. Now  he was found guilty in at least a dozen charges  including terrorism  murder  and arson and faces the possibility of life in prison now.\n\nRusesabagina was celebrated in the Hollywood film for saving more than 1 200 people in the 1994 genocide. More recently  though  he has become one of the harshest critics of Rwandan President Paul Kagame. The activist has said the allegations against him are a fabrication and an attempt by the government to quiet dissent.']",yahoo finance akiko fujita break today top story around world n nvideo transcript n n music playing n nakiko fujita world view today roughly people evacuate spain volcano erupt canary island cumbre vieja erupt la palma sunday follow several earthquake weekend create two fissure within volcano fast move lava already destroy home building path lava nearly foot high area local official say injury report far archipelago first eruption year expert say could last week even month n nrussian police arrest year old student connection school shoot kill six people official say suspect enter campus perm state university mile east moscow monday morning begin shoot teacher student lock classroom others jump window safety nearly people injured attack include shooter n nreuters report suspect student university buy hunt rifle use back may attack come four month another school shoot kill nine people russia raise minimum age buy firearm shoot new law go effect yet n nand man inspire film hotel rwanda find guilty part terror group kigali judge convict paul rusesabagina others form illegally arm group conspire attack rwanda find guilty least dozen charge include terrorism murder arson face possibility life prison n nrusesabagina celebrate hollywood film save people genocide recently though become one harsh critic rwandan president paul kagame activist say allegation fabrication attempt government quiet dissent,0.6952299304327907,1

How sport is helping to heal wounds in Rwanda - Evening Standard,https://www.standard.co.uk/escapist/travel/how-sport-is-helping-to-heal-wounds-in-rwanda-a3648626.html,['Y ou’re going where?” “To Rwanda ” we said. “Are you taking the children?” “Yes ” we replied. Isn’t it where they had that genocide? Is it safe? Why are you taking three children under six there?\n\nThis conversation was repeated many times over the six months it took us to plan our family trip to Rwanda for half-term. We tried to explain to friends and family that we thought of the trip not so much as a holiday but as an adventure and a life-enhancing experience for the children and us as a family. Still  as we left for the airport the last thing people said to us was  “stay safe” — most clearly remained sceptical about our plan.\n\nWe initially decided to travel to Rwanda to take part in a rugby coaching tour that the innovative charity Friends of Rwandan Rugby (FoRR) runs every year. Sport in Rwanda plays a big role in helping heal the wounds left behind by the 1994 genocide  and FoRR provides children with new memories and shared experiences through rugby. Teaching a new sport to hundreds of children on a Monday and ending the week with a tag rugby tournament can be gruelling but creates incredible moments for everyone involved and we wanted the girls to be part of it.\n\nOnce we had decided to put the trip together around the coaching tour  we hit a stumbling block. Rwanda  it seems  is still regarded by the adventure travel industry as an adults-only destination. The reason to travel to Rwanda  in their view  is to see the gorillas and other primates you can’t visit until you are 15. However  we weren’t about to give up  and eventually came across Katina  of World Fusion Tours  an Australian based in Rwanda. She understood our aims and our concerns and we set about creating an itinerary that was about more than gorillas.\n\nGorillas in Volcanoes National Park / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nWe arrived into Kigali late on our first evening with three exhausted children  and were delighted with the oasis that is the Kigali Marriott. Using this as our base for the first two days of the trip gave us space to enjoy the modern  bustling capital city. After a lazy morning taking advantage of the pool at the hotel we spent the afternoon on a community tour of Kigali visiting the Nyamirambo Women’s Centre  a collective that runs walking tours  hair-braiding and basket-weaving classes  followed by a trip to the Niyo Cultural Centre  which displays local art and teaches traditional Rwandan dancing and drumming to street kids. It was a very different experience to our previous holiday  when the girls had their hair styled at Disney’s Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique — but was significantly more rewarding.\n\nOur week in schools teaching rugby was fantastic yet challenging. We left Kigali on a yellow school bus with no seat belts accompanied by 14 boisterous rugby players — it was a fun experience and our normal essential safety requirements were being peeled back day by day.\n\nInto the wild: Burchell’s zebras in Akagera National Park  Rwanda / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nOur base for the week in the district of Ruhango wasn’t set up for tourists  and there was a distinct lack of facilities: there was no running water at points and while the kids were overjoyed at taking bucket baths  the lack of this basic resource with three small children was hard at times. Then I remembered that this is how a significant proportion of the world lives every day and decided we could manage for a week.\n\nBut as the week progressed and got better and better we realised we had made the right decision. Rwandans love children  “one child is everyone’s child” being the ethos. As a family we were welcomed with huge smiles everywhere we went. The kids  while a little overwhelmed at their celebrity status  conducted class singalongs and large games of duck  duck  goose. They played rugby with the younger kids and began to appreciate how much they have back home  and how lucky they are in comparison with many others. They also noticed how much the children of Ruhango smiled  despite having little to call their own.\n\nHowever  it was with some excitement that we were collected from Ruhango at the end of the week by our driver Jimmy in a rather large and solid- looking Jeep (with — what joy — seatbelts!). It was time to explore the rest of this beautiful country  nicknamed The Land of a Thousand Hills. We drove through winding hills towards Lake Kivu and INZU Lodge at Gisenyi — the paddleboarding and fabulous views could have kept us longer but we had more to see.\n\nUgandan children play rugby\n\nFrom Gisenyi we made our way to Villa Gorilla in Musanze  from where we hoped to see the famous mountain gorillas (thanks to pre-arranged childcare). But it wasn’t all adults-only — we took a fantastic family canoe trip along the Mukungwa river.

Priests conviction a reminder that Rwandas wounds are still open,https://www.ncronline.org/news/priests-conviction-reminder-rwandas-wounds-are-still-open,"['By JOHN L. ALLEN JR.\n\nNew York\n\nThe Dec. 13 conviction of Fr. Athanase Seromba by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda offers the latest reminder that the wounds from the astonishingly rapid 1994 genocide are far from healed in that African nation of 8 million  roughly half of whom are Catholic.\n\nSeromba was the first Catholic priest to be convicted by the international tribunal  although the trial of a second  Fr. Emmanuel Rukundo  a former army chaplain in northern Rwanda  began in mid-November. In 2000  the tribunal acquitted Bishop Augustin Misago  of the southern diocese of Gikongoro  of charges that he deliberately sent 19 Tutsi schoolgirls to their deaths at the hand of Hutu extremists.\n\nThe international court  however  is not the only way that Catholic personnel have been charged with complicity in the killing.\n\nSome have been tried and convicted in traditional village courts  called “gacaca.” The latest case involved a Catholic nun  Sr .Theopister Mukakibibi  who was sentenced to 30 years in prison on November 10. She was accused of denying food  medication and care to patients at the University Central Hospital  and also of driving Tutsi patients out of the hospital in the knowledge that killers were waiting.\n\nOther Rwandan priests and nuns have stood trial in military courts  or overseas.\n\nOn November 16  for example  a military tribunal convicted Fr. Wenceslas Munyeshyaka in a trial held in absentia. Munyeshyaka  now in France  was accused of committing rape and aiding militiamen in the genocide. The prosecutor vowed to request extradition. In 2001 Sr. Julienne Maria Kizito and her Mother Superior  Sr. Gertrude Mukangango  were sentenced by a Belgian court to 12 and 15 years in prison  respectively. They were accused of calling in militiamen to drive out Tutsis who had sought refuge in their convent at Sovu.\n\nTo be fair  this was hardly just a Catholic phenomenon  and leaders of other denominations have also been prosecuted. Last week  Seventh Day Adventist pastor Elizaphan Ntakirutimana  convicted by the international tribunal and sentenced to 10 years a decade ago  became its first convict to be released after serving his time.\n\nMoreover  it should be noted that Seromba has proclaimed his innocence  and his attorney  a Benin national who is among the founders of ""Lawyers Without Borders "" has argued that the court wanted to convict him largely for the bureaucratic motive of justifying its massive expenditures.\n\nStill  the Seromba case and others like it represent a challenge to the conscience of the Rwandan Catholic community  to try to come to terms with how savagery on such a vast scale – one million dead in 100 days  a rate of killing three times faster than the Holocaust – could have happened in a country which  at least nominally  has a strong Catholic culture.\n\nOne Rwanda Catholic asking such questions is Jesuit Fr. Elisee Rutagambwa  currently writing a dissertation at Boston College on the response of the Church and the international community to genocide.\n\nRutagambwa the eighth and last child of a Tutsi family  has suffered in first person the convulsions that have swept through Rwanda. In mass-killings that began in 1963  he lost his father  two uncles  his grandparents  and his sister  who was four when she and her grandmother and grandfather were attacked with machetes and thrown in a river. His brother was killed in the violence in Burundi in 1993  and 40 members of his extended family in Rwanda in 1994.\n\nRutagambwa was on the phone with a cousin in Rwanda on April 7  1994  who was describing the outbreak of violence when the line went dead. Later  he learned she had been murdered.\n\nI heard Rutagambwa speak in July at a congress of Catholic theological ethicists in Padua  Italy  and the comments he made seem worth revisiting in light of the Seromba conviction.\n\n“It’s amazing that genocide is not a major issue in ethics today  since the 20th century was the century of genocide ” Rutagambwa said. “Theologians don’t really talk about it  even social ethicists avoid it. It’s not a focal issue for us.”\n\nNoting that the Rwandan killing claimed the lives of one in seven people living in the country at the time  he asked his audience to imagine what a similar level of decimation would have meant in the United States or China.\n\n“This was father on son  mother on daughter ” Rutagambwa said. “Doctors killed their patients  teachers killed their students  priests killed their parishioners. This was total destruction. People were taught to hate each other.”\n\n\n\nPerhaps  Rutagambwa said  one might be tempted to dismiss what happened in Rwanda as a descent into African tribal savagery  unfortunate but basically impossible to control. Yet the 20th century also witnessed genocides in the heart of European civilization  he said.\n\nThe tragic reality  Rutagambwa said  is that Rwanda was the “most preventable” genocide on record. There were United Nations resolutions and even a small U.N. force on the ground  he said  and the West clearly possessed the capacity to intervene. He noted that as the killing broke out  all the Westerners were evacuated  “including their dogs and cats ” while the Rwandans were left largely to fend for themselves.\n\nThough Rutagambwa did not specifically examine the role of the Catholic Church  he did say that the ethnic polarization of Rwanda into Hutus and Tutsis was largely a product of the colonial era  and was reinforced by the Church.\n\n“Prior to colonialism  there was already a nation of Rwanda  with a common authority and administration ” Rutagambwa said. “There was no sharp division between Hutus and Tutsis  and in fact in some regions Hutus and Tutsis were found in the same clan.”\n\nThe Belgian colonial authorities  following the classic strategy of “divide and conquer ” elevated first the Tutsis and then the Hutus  using the promise of privilege to one group to keep the other in line. The Church  he said  to some extent followed suit  and largely for the same reasons.\n\nRutagambwa faulted much press coverage for not raising such issues  saying instead that the genocide was covered “like Red Sox games  with one box score after another.”\n\nOn the subject of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda  Rutagambwa was not terribly sanguine.\n\n“Ironically  the prisoners get three meals a day  they have access to computers  they get anti-retroviral medications from the prison hospital if they’re HIV-positive ” Rutagambwa said. “The victims get nothing.”\n\nCorruption and mismanagement have also soured Rwandans  he said  along with the relatively feeble efforts of the Rwandan government to duplicate the “truth and reconciliation” model of post-apartheid South Africa.\n\n“For the government  ‘reconciliation’ basically means releasing people from jail ” he said. “It’s peculiar to Rwanda.”']",john l allen jr n nnew york n nthe dec conviction fr athanase

"Rwandas Kagame wins poll, grenade wounds 7 | Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rwanda-election-idUSTRE67A3VH20100811,['KIGALI (Reuters) - Incumbent Paul Kagame won 93 percent of the votes in Rwanda’s presidential election  final results showed on Wednesday  after a campaign that critics said was marred by government repression.\n\nA grenade was thrown into a rush-hour crowd in the capital Kigali  wounding at least seven people. Analysts said the attack appeared to be aimed at producing a political crisis.\n\nKagame  widely lauded for rebuilding Rwanda and establishing peace in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide  won the last election in 2003 by a similar margin. Wednesday’s results still have to be signed off by the Supreme Court.\n\n“We are very happy with the conduct of the electoral process  from the campaign to the voting itself. We did not get reports of intimidation from anywhere ” said Charles Munyaneza  executive secretary of the electoral body.\n\nTurnout for Monday’s election was more than 95 percent in all the nation’s five provinces.\n\nKagame’s nearest rival  Jean Damascene Ntawukuliryayo of the Social Democratic Party  won 5 percent. Prosper Higiro of the Liberal Party garnered just over 1 percent and Alvera Mukabaramba of the Party for Peace and Concord 0.4 percent.\n\nOpponents said the other candidates were a democratic smokescreen and stooges of Kagame’s Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). They also said the campaign playing field had been uneven  with three would-be opposition candidates prevented from registering to contest the ballot.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nOne of them  Victoire Ingabire  head of the United Democratic Forces party who faces charges of funding rebels in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo and espousing genocide ideology  rejected the result.\n\nGRENADE ATTACK\n\nPolice spokesman Eric Kayiranga said seven people including two children were wounded in a grenade blast outside a Kigali bus park on Wednesday evening.\n\n“It was thrown into the middle of a crowd. It was rush hour and people were going home. Three suspects were arrested on the spot ” he told Reuters.\n\nThe attack was “a terrible and cowardly act of violence ” he added in a police statement. “There are no other security concerns in Kigali or around the country ” he said.\n\nSecurity agents quickly sealed off the area  denying access to journalists. Eyewitnesses put the number of wounded at closer to 20 and said bloodstains were visible on the roadside.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\n“Grenade attacks are never an attempt to overthrow the government but rather to influence the political climate. At most they could provoke the RPF to clamp down on civil liberties and thereby create a political crisis ” said Rwanda expert Jason Stearns.\n\nAnother regional analyst who cannot be identified said: “It does show that opposition to Kagame is unlikely to come via the ballot box.”\n\nHuman rights groups pointed to mounting violence during the run-up to the election after the shooting dead of a local journalist and the killing of an opposition official who was found nearly beheaded in July. The government strenuously denied any involvement.\n\n“It was a climate of intimidation and exclusion of the opposition and critical voices. It was a climate of fear ” Carina Tertsakian  Rwanda researcher for Human Rights Watch  told Reuters by telephone from London.\n\nThe European Union congratulated Rwanda for the calm atmosphere on polling day and high voter turnout and said the election marked a new stage in Rwanda’s democratic process and development.\n\nBut it said it was concerned by the pre-election incidents and called for swift and transparent investigations.\n\nKagame has been in control of the land-locked nation of 10 million people since his rebel army swept to power in the aftermath of the genocide of 800 000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.\n\nDespite being poor in natural resources  Rwanda is a rising star in Africa for donors and investors with Kagame feted as a visionary leader and African icon.

Rwanda: A wounded generation | Pambazuka News,https://www.pambazuka.org/human-security/rwanda-wounded-generation,"[""African Rights\n\nDISCUSSION PAPER No. 14 April 2006\n\nA WOUNDED GENERATION\n\nTHE CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED RWANDA’S GENOCIDE\n\nAs part of the genocide commemoration this year  Saturday 8 April will be devoted to children. Among the horrific accounts of the Rwandese genocide which African Rights has gathered since 1994  the stories told by children have enormous impact. An entire generation lost their childhood and will be forever scarred by their memories. Children were slashed with machetes  shot at and subjected to all manner of abuse during the genocide; girls  some as young as six or seven  were frequently raped. Many child survivors lost their parents or siblings in the massacres; many witnessed the murders themselves. They watched as their neighbours  teachers and the parents of their friends and classmates—and sometimes even their relatives—killed their parents and close relatives. They have been left to bear the legacy of physical injuries and emotional anguish  often without even minimal support of a social network. Their views of human relationships were subverted overnight  and their incomprehension in the face of the catastrophe permeates their moving testimonies. Nonetheless  the visions of the genocide offered by its child victims also contain astonishing revelations and examples of resilience.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe genocide  with its broad-ranging consequences  has affected every aspect of the lives of young survivors  individually and collectively  in both practical and emotional terms. It continues to define their relationship to their surviving relatives  to classmates  friends  teachers  to each other  to the wider community and the outside world. Whether they were very young in 1994  and are now teenagers  or teenagers then and now young adults  the shadow of the genocide is a tangible and painful part of their everyday life.\n\nFor those who were children in 1994  the breadth and depth of their losses and bereavement have become more pronounced with time. Even adults say that the tenacity  resilience and morale of survivors is diminishing  rather than improving  as the years go by. A teacher in Kigali spoke about the cumulative impact of the last 12 years on children.\n\nAs time passes  the impact deepens and becomes more and more visible. Those who were very young during the genocide  and who didn’t know what was happening  have for now grown up in a bad environment where they feel the full weight of what happened. That can only increase their bitterness every day. They have never known love and cannot  therefore  love others in return. When you go to commemoration services in memory of the victims  you see clearly that the morale of survivors is on the decline. Their hearts are much more wounded. They are the living-dead who  rightly  feel that they have been abandoned by their fellow-citizens and by the world. And on top of all that  comes the extreme poverty which they face after having lost everything during the genocide.\n\nI don’t know why the sorrow has increased instead of diminishing. I think in 1995  and until about 2000  they still hoped that justice would be done. But now  they have been disappointed and they have no hope of justice. And that affects them enormously.\n\nA teacher who received training in counselling in Butare agreed that the problems of some children worsen with age.\n\nThe older the survivors get  the more they are saddened and troubled by the genocide. That’s why a lot of the survivors who are at secondary schools are traumatised. It’s because they have a growing awareness of what they actually went through during the genocide.\n\nThomas  who was 17 when the world he had known came to an end  echoed these views.\n\nJust after the genocide  we were hopeful about justice. But now  we see that we must lie with injustice. This makes me feel morally insecure. I can’t explain this sense of insecurity  so I can’t go and complain to the police. All survivors feel this insecurity  and it is that  more than anything else  which undermines us. Because it has an effect on all aspects of our life  including education.\n\nWhen There is No Way to Forget\n\nVestine Umugwaneza was aged 11 in 1994. Her family lived in Rusatira in Butare. Her father  brothers and sisters died in the massacres at the agricultural research centre of ISAR/Songa between the 24-28 April. She was left to comfort her mother who had become distraught. At night  they searched the nearby ravines for sweet potatoes and manioc which they ate raw. At the end of four days  Vestine’s mother had gone beyond what she could endure and disappeared. Despite the danger  Vestine returned to their home and discovered her mother’s body in their living room. She found a bottle of poison lying by her mother’s side.\n\nVestine’s life was destroyed at ISAR.\n\nI have led a miserable life since the genocide of April 1994. I went through a terrible time when they went after the thousands of Tutsi refugees at ISAR/Songa. I will never forget that time. How can I? The massacre at ISAR changed my life forever. I was the only survivor from my family. I became an orphan at a very young age. I had to leave school  not for lack of means  but because of psychological problems. I had trouble remembering things after the massacre.\n\nGiselle   living in Mudasomwa in Gikongoro  was also 11 at the time. With many of her relatives  she joined the exodus to a school under construction in Murambi  on the outskirts of Gikongoro town. The school came under a well-organized attack at 3:00 a.m. on 21 April. Giselle’s parents  two younger brothers  a younger sister and her grandparents died at Murambi. Her grandparents and sister were killed in front of her.\n\nFortunate to find a caring guardian  she was able to finish secondary school and has a job. She regrets that her salary does not allow her to pursue further education  but she considers herself fortunate compared to other survivors when it comes to the practical impact of the genocide.\n\nWhen I compare myself to the other orphans  I believe I am very lucky. The other children of my age who lost their parents during the genocide could not continue with their studies  many have become cleaners  others are prostitutes to find the money to survive and are dying of AIDS. They also see that I am in a better situation than they are. And yet I equally have a long road to travel  may be not equal to theirs as I at least have something.\n\nThe consequences of the genocide which impact a lot on me are those relating to the loss of my whole family. I can’t bear to hear others saying that they are going to see their parents as it makes me think of mine. I often think of all that they were and all that they would have been for me.\n\nLike so many survivors  Giselle is haunted by the fact that she has not been able to give her parents and siblings a dignified burial.\n\nThe people who were killed at Murambi were thrown in mass graves. No-one is sure they have buried their own relatives who were at Murambi  but they tried to believe it to avoid torment. Personally  I condemn myself for not having buried my parents  brothers and sisters. It is the one thing that I could have offered them and I have not been able to do it. Sometimes  when I am in bed  I dream of what happened to my family  my friends and cousins. I see my family again as they were before the genocide… I often lose myself in thought and ask why God permitted such a horror. Even today  I don’t understand it and have not been able to reconcile myself to the genocide.\n\nJean-Baptiste  who was 15 in 1994 and is a native of commune Mbogo in Greater Kigali. His mother  two sisters  one of them a primary school teacher and the other a student  and a brother who was at school  were among the victims of the genocide. In 1995  his father also died. Jean-Baptiste was then a student at the Ecole Technique Officielle in Kibungo. He found that thinking about his life—past and present—distracted him from his studies.\n\nSome days  I think about my mother and my brothers and sisters. Even my grandmother was killed and she was eighty. Thinking about this almost drives me mad and prevents me from studying as I should  especially when I remember a photo of all the members of my family. We had a photo like this in an album which was stolen. This photo often returns to my mind. It reminds me of my dead brothers and sisters  of the way some of them were torn to pieces by grenades. This thought often comes to me during my homework in the evening. Tears follow thoughts like this. After I cry I feel better. I unconsciously find myself reflecting on these things. It’s certainly difficult for me to do as well as I should.\n\nI also get sad when the children are visited by members of their families. I don’t think it’s due to jealousy. My family were killed by people; they didn’t die from illness. They were tortured before being killed. When I see people passing by  even strangers  I say to myself  from the heart: “May be he killed people.”\n\nI want to go home to Ngaru to reflect upon the life I led there with my parents  my brothers and my sisters. There were a lot of people around me. Now there is no longer any happiness without my parents. We buried the remains of my mother and my two older sisters in 1995 before my father died. I will never forget seeing the remains of my beloved mother.\n\nWhen I think about the children of my age who were killed simply for being Tutsi  it makes me want to leave this country and go and live or die far away from here. I’m incapable of understanding  or accepting  this sudden loss of such a large number of people.\n\nBeginning a new life after the genocide is a constant reminder of the absence of loved ones  as Thomas  who was 17 in 1994  remarked.\n\nEvery survivor had to start his or her life from zero after the genocide : to make new friends and construct a new life. It’s as if we were born a second time  but this time in a society where the social fabric has been torn to pieces and where we must live side by side with the perpetrators. Even if I’m fortunate enough to still have my mother  I lost my father  my brothers  friends  neighbours and relatives. They cannot be replaced. We will miss them forever and it will be impossible to fill the emptiness they left behind.\n\nCharlotte Ingabire was only 15 when she spoke as if she had already lived too long. Charlotte’s entire family was massacred in front of her in their home in Gisuma  Cyangugu.\n\nI’m dead  even if others see me as alive. I hid so I wouldn’t die. This is how I’ve come to be suffering alone  with no consolation and with no-one to rely on in the difficult conditions in which I find myself today. Where my family is  there is no suffering. Why did I remain on this cursed earth  full of more interahamwe than I can count  who killed my family and destroyed everything which belonged to the Tutsis?\n\nIt is unlikely that Elizaphan Ndayisaba will ever have peace of mind. He keeps asking why his neighbours left him without his brothers Ndagijimana and Mbonimpaye  to talk to and play with. Aged 12 in 1994  he had already left school to do what he loved best  to look after cows on the green pastures of Bisesero. Overnight  the hills he had come to love turned into a war zone as thousands of Tutsis fought pitched battles against soldiers  gendarmes  communal policemen and militiamen.\n\nOne day the militiamen and soldiers attacked us. The little children started to cry. My mother put Nyirakanyana on her back and my older brother did the same with Mbonimpaye. We then ran in different directions. Many people were killed that day. When the militiamen had gone home  someone came to tell me that my whole family had been killed. When I heard this  I went to every hill to try and find their bodies.\n\nI carried on looking until I came across my mother’s body and my little sister who was on her back. They were both dead. My elder brother was next to my mother and on his back was Mbonimaye. My older brother was still breathing but the child on his back was dead. The dogs were coming to eat the corpses. I watched how my mother  who had nursed me  was going to be eaten by dogs. I felt sad. She was lying there without any clothes on.\n\nA few months later  after a stint in an orphanage in Gitarama  Elizaphan returned to Bisesero. It was a sad homecoming.\n\nI had to live with my paternal uncle because my parents were dead and all our possessions had been destroyed. My uncle was alone too. I had to do all the work and I spent all day farming so that we wouldn’t die of hunger. I didn’t farm before the genocide. I don’t know where to go to get anything back. My father had a lot of cows and other things which were worth something. My uncle does not have the time to help me. I am alone so I can’t cultivate my father’s fields. All that is left now are bushes.\n\nAt night  instead of sleeping  Elizaphan reflects on the projects “that have come to nothing”  but above all on the circumstances in which he finds himself.\n\nI wonder why I ever left school. I thought that my father would give me a lot of cows and build me a house.\n\nBefore the genocide  my brothers and I would chat and play together before going to sleep. Now when I go to bed I think about the genocide. When I close my eyes I see all the bodies that were at Bisesero  especially the one of my mother with the child on her back. I have become disheartened. Nothing seems to give me back my courage. I don’t know what my future will be anymore.\n\nThere is no one to shield him against the shame and hurt he feels.\n\nOther children my age  who still have their parents  wear new clothes on special days  for example at Christmas  and when they go to mass. However  I am left feeling sad and I look at my clothes which are all worn. I wonder why they killed my parents and the other Tutsis who gave me things. I wonder what we have done to have to suffer like this for the rest of our lives. I haven’t been able to answer this question.\n\nIn 1992  Justin Twagiramungu’s mother was killed in Mbogo  Greater Kigali  with his baby sister of three weeks strapped on her back. His seven-year-old sister was burnt alive. Justin had made it in time to his grandmother’s house. His father and three of his brothers were killed in 1994. His young brother and sister who remained were taken in by the Saint Elizabeth orphanage. He mingled with the huge crowds en route to Zaire in July and ended up in Mugunga camp. In 1995 he eventually traced his way back to Rwanda.\n\nI don’t think there’s anything that could make me happy now. Nothing will bring my family back to life. I’ve got nobody to talk to. Until 1992  I didn’t have a care in the world. My parents looked after me and all my brothers and sisters. Now  I spend night after night lying awake  thinking about my future and the future of the children I’m responsible for. If my parents had lived  I would’ve carried on with my studies. And my parents would have looked after us. If only my brothers were still alive... I was the eldest. Alfred  who came next  was just a little younger than me. He would’ve helped me look after the two little ones if he hadn’t been killed. None of them did any harm to the people who killed them. They were tortured before they died. And I’ll feel tortured for the rest of my life. I can’t commit suicide  but I sometimes think death would solve all my problems. I think that especially at night  when I can’t sleep.\n\nEven a life abroad  free of the demons of the genocide  is beyond Justin’s imagination.\n\nSometimes I want to go and live in a far-off country  so I can forget the genocide and the ruins of Tutsis’ homes. But then I remember I might meet commander Stanislas Kinyoni  one of the main people responsible for the genocide.\n\nNo-One to Lean On\n\nFor children and young people  parents and close adults are not only a source of love and economic support  but of guidance and advice. Even the youngsters who have managed to overcome adversity feel the absence of caring adults in their lives. Brigitte Kankindi and her older brother are all that remain of a family of nine people. Her parents and siblings were killed in Nyanza  Nyabisindu. While her brother was repairing their damaged houses  Brigitte finished her secondary education and worked in Nyanza hospital. She then went to university. Her brother returned to secondary school. They live together with two young female cousins  both 23  the only survivors of their respective families. They do the best they can  but regret that there are no adults they can look to as anchors for security and confidence.\n\nWe are a family of young people only. We have learned to take on all responsibilities after my parents’ death. We have no-one to give us advice or to set us straight. No-one in my father’s family  except for our two cousins  is alive. They used to be a large family. We have a few maternal aunts but they live far away and we see each other rarely.\n\nDespite their own problems  they helped the orphans of the genocide who were attending a nearby nursing school  sharing their meals with those who lived far away. To support themselves  Brigitte and her brother rented out the houses they had rebuilt.\n\nAlthough they are no longer there  Justine Nyiransabimana continues to hold her family close to her heart. Just before the genocide began  Justine’s mother went to visit her own family in Bugesera  taking the youngest child  a one-year-old boy. It was the last time Justine saw them; they were killed there  along with their relatives. Justine’s four younger sisters and brothers were killed in Mbogo  the commune where they lived. Justine and her father got separated and found each other in August 1994. They began to repair their house and their lives. The information her father provided contributed to the imprisonment of a number of genocide suspects. He remarried and  in March 1996  Justine had a new sister. Two weeks later  he was killed in front of his house. Justine suspects that he was murdered by the families whose relatives he had imprisoned.\n\nI cannot forget my family. When I feel unhappy  I wish that I could die so that I can join them. I will not find happiness as long as I live. It is impossible to get my mother and father back. I will never have a brother or sister. I am all alone in this world. Perhaps I will see them on resurrection day. But when will this take place?\n\nJustine lives in Bugesera with her maternal uncle and his eldest daughter and has  in her words  “found joy again.” But she misses the company of an older female relative in the household.\n\nI don’t have any aunts. My uncle looks after me but he is a man. I want someone who can reassure me but I can’t find anyone. I wish I had an aunt. I don’t  however  have the choice.\n\nThe depth of their loss is brought home to the survivors on social occasions. Because people generally socialise as a unit—either as couples or as families—it is difficult to re-invent oneself and to be sociable on one’s own  or to find joy in gatherings which simply underline the extent to which one’s family and circle of friends had diminished. As such  school holidays  weekends  Christmas  New Year  birthdays and weddings are often filled with emptiness.\n\nEmmanuel Uwizeyimana  17  longed for his father  older brothers and uncles when his sister  Donata  decided to get married. Although happy for his sister  he found himself trapped in the past as he prepared for the wedding  thinking about his parents and the eight brothers and sisters who should have been there.\n\nBefore the genocide  my older brothers and sisters had been married. On their wedding day  we got lots of beers and people came to the house to celebrate and brought presents for the married couple. My father had prepared speeches to welcome the visitors. Grandparents  other members of the family and neighbours came to the party. My older sisters bought many things—plates  clothes and suitcases—for the new household.\n\nHe had to make decisions beyond his years.\n\nA marriage demands a lot of ceremony and money. I looked for an older man to take my father’s place. I wondered how I could provide for Donata’s marriage. I went to Mbogo and claimed my father’s cows  which had been taken by militiamen during the genocide. I sold the cows I found to raise the money. I got 80 000 francs and other survivors helped me. With this money my sister bought the things she needed. My sister’s husband brought the beer. I found an older man to take my father’s part in the marriage ceremony.\n\nThe wedding was not a joyous occasion.\n\nThere were a few of us drinking beer in our little house. It didn’t feel like a celebration. The conversation was about the genocide. I heard people saying: “It would have been better if their parents were still alive.” We accompanied my sister to the Parish of Gihogwe in Rutongo for the religious ceremonies and afterwards her husband took her to Butare.\n\nForced to drop out of school because of poverty  he decided to become a farmer which only heightened his loneliness. When a charity donated corrugated iron  windows and doors to the survivors of Mbogo  the older survivors helped Emmanuel build a house. He moved in on 1 May 1997. He was delighted to find a nephew  the son of his brother. Taking care of him has given meaning to Emmanuel’s life  but the child cannot fulfil his need for companionship.\n\nWe are surrounded by the families of the militiamen who killed my family. The child spends all day at school. I stay alone in the house and there is no-one to talk to me. My neighbours will never come to my house. They say I am their enemy  though I have done nothing to them. They are the ones who murdered my family.\n\nThe pace at which his neighbours work their fields made him realise how much his world had shrunk.\n\nI no longer have the courage to farm. My neighbours who see me farming alone laugh at me because I can work on a small patch for more than a week  whereas they could even plough a whole hill in a few hours because the father  mother and the children all go to the fields to farm. I cannot find anyone to help me. I cannot even get married. I’m still young. I have no security and I think I will be killed one day. I care for the child and I look for study materials for him.\n\nRégine Uwase finds the period of commemoration especially unbearable.\n\nI stay in bed until the commemoration is over.\n\nWhen the friend she lives with became engaged  the gathering turned into a sad occasion.\n\nIt was very hard for us to find someone to preside over the ceremony.\n\nThe death of parents  grandparents and siblings creates regret and fear not only about links to one’s past  but also concerns about continuity to the future. Marie-Rose Uwizeyimana lives with an elderly aunt  who has since taken in three other orphans. She and her husband do their best to support the children  but their age and lack of means is never far from Marie-Rose’s mind.\n\nIf I didn’t have my aunt  what would happen to me? Now that she is ill  I am afraid that she will die and leave me alone. I have no-one else. My other uncles  aunts and cousins were killed. I am constantly afraid that my old relatives will die. I would have nowhere to go. I am the eldest of the other children and I am still too young to work.\n\nAdults Before Their Time\n\nThe genocide has robbed thousands of children of their parents  extended families  their homes and their childhood. Many children and young people have been forced to assume responsibility for the remaining members of their family  often at the expense of their own well-being.\n\nAt 16  Julienne Umugwaneza lived through the horrors which left about 50 000 Tutsi men  women and children dead on 21 April 1994 at a school under construction in Murambi  outside Gikongoro town. She later met up with her two younger sisters and their maternal uncle took them with him to Kigali. They lived there until 1997. But aware of the pressure on the family which had taken in many other orphans  they went to live with their paternal uncle. Julienne married a soldier and had three children with him; they later separated.\n\nIt’s very difficult for me to guarantee their education. But I have to manage because I don’t have anyone left from our family to share the responsibility with. I share these troubles with many other genocide survivors. We must  for better or worse  ensure our own survival in extreme solitude. Others have families they can turn to in times of need  but we are condemned to live in this way.\n\nIn addition to her own children  Julienne is looking after her two sisters who are attending secondary school. Their fees are paid by the FARG  but she must meet all their expenses and tries to do so from the income of her family’s fields.\n\nI ended my schooling in order to dedicate myself to my younger sisters’ education. I had done the first year of secondary school in 1995 and I did well. But I couldn’t continue because at that time the FARG had not been set up to help me. I therefore chose to devote myself to ensuring that my little sisters would not miss out on their education as I did.\n\nMarie-Chantal Mukansange’s parents died when she was three years old. She lived with her grandmother; after her death  she and her younger sister moved in with their aunt who lived in Mbogo  Greater Kigali. They scattered in different directions after their home was destroyed on 10 April. Marie-Chantal  then fifteen  eventually found her sister and aunt. Two of their neighbours  including a headmaster  gathered the Tutsis in the area and separated the men and women. The men were shot and finished off with machetes. The women were driven to a communal graveyard located near the marketplace.\n\nOne by one  each woman and girl was struck on the back of the neck with a hammer and then immediately thrown into the large well where there were other dead people.\n\nIn the evening  Marie-Chantal climbed out of the pit. She was saved by a Hutu woman whose Tutsi husband had been killed. When a civil servant asked to employ her as a domestic worker  her host encouraged her to accept. She lied to protect her  saying she was her niece. She fled with this family to Zaire in July 1994  and met up with the woman who had originally befriended her. She lived with her until they returned to Rwanda together in September 1996. To her joy and surprise  she discovered that her sister  Marie-Rose  14  was still alive. At the time of the interview  the two girls were living together in a house given to them by a family friend. Marie-Chantal looks after her younger sister who attends primary school.\n\nI cultivate but I don’t have enough strength. I rent out fields and find money to take on one paid labourer to cultivate the rest of the fields. We have no-one. All the members of our family were killed during the genocide.\n\nMarie-Chantal had completed sixth year of primary school just before April 1994. She would have liked to continue her education  but lack of money and her sister’s dependence on her have forced her to put her own aspirations on hold.\n\nI had good marks. If my aunt had stayed alive she would have put me in secondary school. But now I don’t have any money and I have to stay at the house to prepare the food. I have no choice but to live like this. When the food runs out  I worry a lot for my younger sister.\n\nApprehension about their security is another source of unease.\n\nWe spend our nights alone in the house and I get very frightened by the smallest thing. I don’t sleep well.\n\nIt has not been possible to close the door to the past  and the nights are not restful either.\n\nI always see the ruins of our house. I see Tutsi neighbours who had children of my age and whose families were wiped out. I live in eternal pain. I saw terrible things. I had never seen a dead person before. I was frightened of dead bodies. Even when my grandmother died  before the genocide  I refused to see her body. But during the genocide I saw lots of dead bodies and people in agony. This will never be wiped from my memory. When I sleep at night and dream  these images come back to me and frighten me. I also dream about the militia chasing me  in order to kill me.\n\nUwayisenga was seven when the killings began. Her family took refuge on the hills of Bisesero. A man who worked for her father and who she considered a family friend brought a machete down on her head and stuck pieces of wood into her face. He left her for dead. Her mother washed her injuries with water. She hid her in the bush where they stayed until the arrival of French troops who transferred her to a hospital in Goma. Her father and four of her five siblings were killed. Her mother married Uwayisenga’s uncle whose own family had perished and in time she had a new baby sister. But her future was blighted by the injuries from the machete as she was forced to leave school.\n\nStill  I was happy to see my mother taking care of me and I looked after the baby.\n\nBut the contentment that Uwayisenga drew from her family did not last long. In February 1997  her mother died suddenly.\n\nWhen I heard that she was dead  I wanted to kill myself.\n\nHer mother’s death has brought the devastation of the genocide to the forefront of Uwayisenga’s life.\n\nWhen I go to bed  I immediately think about how the genocide was carried out in Bisesero. My head hurts all the time. Before the genocide  I used to eat and sleep without any problems. I did not have to think about my future because my parents looked after me  my brothers and my sisters.\n\nIt also transformed her into a mother  at the age of ten. The narrow shoulders of a child are too weak to carry such a heavy load.\n\nNow I am like an old mother. I wonder how my mother’s baby will grow up. When he cries  I cry too. He gets his food from cows’ milk. Other orphans from the genocide were placed in the orphanage of Nyamishaba in Gitesi. I couldn’t abandon my father’s fields to go to an orphanage. I wanted to live here in Bisesero to look after the cows and the baby. I didn’t want to go back to school because I couldn’t see the point of studying.\n\nBecause men were the primary target of the genocide  women constitute a significant percentage of survivors. In a society where it is easier for men to deal with bureaucracy  young men find themselves under constant family pressure  as Thomas testified.\n\nI have a lot of responsibilities which take up a lot of my time  responsibilities which I would not be carrying today if it was not for the genocide. I can’t give my family sufficient time even though I’m the oldest and they really need my presence. Sometimes I even miss classes. The teachers think that I lack discipline  but I can’t tell them the reasons for my absences.\n\nPierre finds himself caught in a similar trap.\n\nBecause many of the survivors in my extended family are women  they ask me to help with this or that urgent matter. And I feel under an obligation to put my studies aside and to assist them. There are priorities that must take precedence over school  and it’s impossible to do anything about it. This has negative consequences for our grades.\n\nRobbed of Their Sanity\n\nDuring the months of April  May and June 1994  thousands of Rwandese children experienced horrors and saw crimes that no child should ever see. Many witnessed massacres or were subjected to physical violence that no words can adequately describe. Their parents and siblings had their throats slit in front of them  were blown apart by bullets and grenades  or seared by clubs. In a last act of love  many parents placed their children underneath them when soldiers and militiamen stormed sanctuaries. These children held their breath as their parents’ bodies were slashed with machetes  their blood pouring over them. Fearful of the killers who returned to massacre sites to finish off the wounded  children—debilitated by hunger and thirst— crouched for days next to the rotting bodies of their parents and other relatives. They watched as dogs devoured the bodies of the people who had loved and protected them. Many of the murderers were men and women whose children were their playmates.\n\nEmerging from these horrors has been further restricted by their encounters with a hostile or indifferent world. Normal relations were turned on their heads in the genocide and children  least of all  can cope with the fact that they knew many of those who murdered their families. Often their own lives were under threat from people who had formerly welcomed them into their homes. No child can be expected to understand or come to terms with this knowledge.\n\nA huge number of children lost not only their parents  but all or most of their siblings  their grandparents  uncles and aunts. For them the only substitute for home became the limited security and support which an orphanage could provide. This was usually the best they could hope for  and some children demonstrated immense courage there  managing to take their first steps towards recovery.\n\nWhile the signs of trauma were most evident in the very young in the first two or three years after the genocide  the fact that trauma is today particularly pronounced among survivors in secondary schools speaks volumes of the hurt and injury in the hearts and minds of those who were very young in 1994.\n\nOlive  aged about three in 1994  was found on the road to Butare. She had been in the Kacyiru orphanage in Kigali for a year when African Rights met her in mid-1996  but had hardly spoken a word. Although her words were not clear  the staff noticed that she was making an effort to improve.\n\nOlive was only able to tell African Rights that she used to live in Butare  and that her mother was called Espérance. But the people who looked after her said the little girl was always calling for her parents  and demanding that they take her to her parents’ home. They could not respond because they did not know her parents’ names  if they were alive and they could not understand what she was telling them.\n\nAt the age of twelve  Floride tried to commit suicide  together with her eleven-year-old sister  Josephine. The two girls ran towards Lake Kivu with the intention of killing themselves after their parents died in a massacre in Rwamatamu  Kibuye. At the edge of the water  the girls met a group of Zairians who took them to the island of Idjwi in their boat. They subsequently went to live with their brother-in-law in Rwamatamu.\n\nBut Josephine  unable to accept the loss of their parents  was deeply unhappy and troubled by nightmares. Floride spoke about the distress her sister feels and about how  as the older child  she is called upon for help. But Floride is unable to do anything.\n\nMy sister asks me if our parents will come back. And then she cries all the time and that also hurts me. I have no way of calming my little sister down  especially during the night when she shouts a lot that the killers are running after her. She calls out their names and it’s the names of the men who murdered our parents.\n\nBut Floride cannot fill the void at the centre of Josephine’s life. Josephine’s questions and her needs—emotional and material—are painful reminders of Floride’s own devastation and sense of helplessness.\n\nShe asks me to give her clothes  when I haven’t got any. That makes me think about the death of my parents who used to give us everything we needed. My little sister doesn’t want to go to school. She wants to stay in the house. I don’t know how to behave in this situation. I am incapable of doing anything to soothe my little sister. I’m also not in good health because they beat me on the back with massues. Even if I was healthy  I couldn’t do anything at my age.\n\nEtienne’s life is a protracted battle to overcome the grief in his heart. This is a weary struggle for a boy of ten. In 1994  he lived in Kigali. His parents were killed but he and his five surviving brothers and sisters were hidden at the Parish of St. Michel and were later taken to the Gisimba orphanage. He returned to school but was frequently away because of sickness as his feet were affected by paralysis. Etienne  nevertheless  tried to hold on to the future.\n\nI am going to stay at the orphanage until the age of at least seventeen  when I will be grown-up. I would like to become a doctor.\n\nDespite his seemingly positive attitude  the extent to which Etienne was at a loss was obvious. He would refuse to talk or to eat. He wouldn’t answer questions  but sit with his mouth closed. The staff had to force him to eat  putting food on a spoon and trying to get him to swallow it  escalating into a battle of wills.\n\nClaudine was shot in the leg as the family fled from Butare to Burundi. Her leg became infected and was later amputated. Her father was also shot and is no longer able to provide for his family as he used to. Claudine has found it difficult to come to terms with both her disability and the very difficult circumstances that the genocide has forced upon the family. Claudine was too withdrawn to be interviewed herself. Her mother spoke of their inability to help their child.\n\nShe gets a complex when she sees others of her age who are in good health  especially because they have two legs and she doesn’t. Claudine asked us for an artificial leg so that she could walk like the others. We have been unable to do anything about Claudine’s problem. Her father really has no resources. Everything was taken from us—especially the cows and the goats which used to bring in some money. Also  because he can’t walk  he can't work to get money. After she asked us for this artificial leg  Claudine became especially anxious and distressed.\n\nThe family do what they can to reach out to Claudine.\n\nI try to calm her down. But nothing works. She doesn’t want us to talk about her life. She wants to be alone; she goes into a corner  crying a lot. If anyone asks her why she is crying  she says: “I’m not crying.” If they say why are you alone here  she says: “It’s my right to be.” I have bought her a crutch. But since the school is far from our home  she sees the other children of her age who are going to school and her anxiety becomes intense. She is always crying. Sometimes she says that we don’t love her. We try to comfort her  but we don’t succeed.\n\nAugustin  from Kibuye  sought to confront the legacy of the genocide with an emotional ferocity that was tearing him apart. Both his parents were killed and he  aged 13  was struck by a machete. Two years later  he could still not speak about his experiences except to mention his parents’ names and to say: “If you are an interahamwe kill me; even my parents are dead. But don’t ask me a lot of questions.”\n\nA fellow-survivor from Augustin’s home area talked about the distraught state in which Augustin was living.\n\nHe witnessed the death of his parents and was cut on the head by machetes. Also  being the only one left in his family causes him a lot of problems. Now he has left school because he used to shout that everyone was a killer  while the teacher was giving a lesson. When he is told to go and draw water  he takes a jerry can then leaves. When he gets to the well he spends the whole day there and leaves the jerry can at the well. If he is asked the question: “Where is the jerry can?”  he says: “Go and look for it. I’m not your servant.” Sometimes he remains calm and doesn’t speak; the alternative is that he cries  especially during the night. We have noticed that he has been affected by the machete cuts on his head.\n\nNeighbours could not find a way to console Augustin. It was clear to them that Augustin needed sustained medical treatment  but the level of poverty in a remote rural area does not afford them the opportunity to help him.\n\nWe try to calm him down  but nothing works. If we could comfort him  for example by taking him to hospital  we would. That requires money we don’t have.\n\nRaped as a Child\n\nRape was used widely as a weapon of genocide. Girls as young as six were gang-raped and kept as sexual slaves both in Rwanda and in the refugee camps set up in neighbouring countries. Many were raped alongside their mothers or sisters  often by the men who had just murdered their fathers  brothers and other relatives. To compound the physical violence and the psychological shock  some of the young girls became pregnant  which subsequently alienated them from their surviving relatives. Many more have endured illness or caught sexually transmitted diseases  including HIV/AIDS.\n\nDévota was seven in April 1994. She lived with her mother and grandparents. The family abandoned their home and Dévota was with her grandmother in the bush when they were found by the interahamwe. They killed her grandmother  but one of the men claimed she was his daughter and took her home with him. Dévota had never seen him before.\n\nHe then began to rape me. He asked me: “Have you seen how the others were killed?” alluding to a boy he’d just handed over. If you don’t do everything that I order you to do  you will also be killed.” He took me when he wanted and did what he wanted to. When I got to the stage that I couldn’t walk anymore  he left me for one or two days. Then he began again. To rape me  he put me on his knees and when I cried  he asked me if I’d really thought that he was my father  as he had told the killers. While he was really hurting me badly  he would tell me  in a nasty manner  to be quiet. I stayed with him for about two months.\n\nHe took Dévota with him to Gikongoro  and then from there he joined the exodus to Zaire. Although Dévota was no longer at his mercy  she had to beg at the market for food. Soon afterwards a gang of street children moved into the house she was staying in.\n\nThere were eight of them. The eldest was 20  but all these children were older than me. They were all boys; I was the only girl. The 8 boys also raped me. Some times they took turns. There were also times when the eldest took pity on me and  after he raped me  he told the others off. He was the strongest; the others were afraid of him. They held me lying on my back while they carried out their will. We lived for a week together like this. Sometimes  they all raped me. Other times it was just the eldest.\n\nA woman who saw her in the market took pity on her. Dévota moved into her house but was left alone with her husband every day and soon he too began to rape her.\n\nHe knew through his wife that I had been raped by several men  so he told me: “Come here  you’ve got nothing to save ” meaning that he wasn’t the first.\n\nDévota was raped by this man “several times” even though she was already visibly suffering from a sexually transmitted disease  the consequence of previous rapes. She was too terrified to tell his wife.\n\nReunited with her mother after the genocide  Dévota has been taken to the doctor regularly with the apparent ongoing symptoms of an STI  despite treatment. She does not appear to have been informed of the specific cause of her illness. However  she has been tested and is not HIV positive. She was in the fifth year of primary school  having had to repeat several times due to frequent absence. Her mother is working and looks after her. Despite visits to the doctor she remains unwell.\n\nThese pains even prevent me from sleeping. I cry out very loudly. So I have to consult a doctor.\n\nI’ve hidden my story from the other children. I don’t want them to make fun of me. They could say that I’m a woman. None of them went through the same problems as I did.\n\nThe man who raped Justine initially took her and another girl to a woman’s house for safety in Nyamata  Greater Kigali. However  one week later the woman was ready to call the Presidential Guard to come and kill them  so he came back and took them to his house.\n\nHe raped me in the absence of his wife on about five occasions. He would choose between me and the other girl; as he raped one  the other would go outside. One day he told us to lift up our clothes. He hit us and said that he would put sticks between our legs  but we begged him not to and he left us alone.\n\nAt the age of just ten  Bernadette was separated from her family and left to crouch in fields near her home in Gishamvu  Butare. An adult man found her there and raped her. During the following days  she remained constantly on the run from the gangs of killers she could hear roaming around. Later  while sheltering in the reeds  she was discovered by another man who also raped her.\n\nAs I was still a young girl  the rape was the first time that I’d had sexual intercourse with a man. It was too painful and it was very hard for me to put up with it. I shouted a lot but the rapists didn’t care. I had difficulty standing up and couldn’t even walk. Before raping me they also hit me. They were offended that I had rejected their offer to sleep with them.\n\nI didn’t recognize any of the men who raped me  so I can’t bring them to justice.\n\nJustine found herself without any family left. She decided to move in with a man  saying that her experience had left her feeling that she “wasn’t a little girl anymore.” She was 12 at the time.\n\nI thought that he would be at the same time my father  my mother and my brother. I married towards the end of 1994. We separated after we had two children; the eldest is now six years old.\n\nShortly before April 1994  Anathalie left her home in Gisuma  Cyangugu  which she shared with her parents and nine brothers and sisters. She had just finished primary school. She went to stay with her older sister in Gikongoro. When the killing started  her sister went to Butare and Anathalie was left alone in Gikongoro  hiding with sympathetic Hutu families or in the bush.\n\nWhen I was in the bush  militiaman raped me three times. There were a lot of rapists and I didn’t know them.\n\nAnathalie was 14 at the time. She returned to Cyangugu after the genocide to live with her sister. Although repeatedly unwell  it was only when she was about to marry that Anathalie was tested. Her HIV-positive diagnosis has destroyed her future and she is visibly crushed. Now in her twenties  Anathalie is watching her life slip away. She found it very difficult to speak about what has happened to her and how she feels.\n\nI hadn’t told my fiancé that I’d been raped during the genocide  but I told him everything once I’d got my results. He was really shocked. The news rekindled my bad memories of the genocide. I had real difficulty in coming to terms with the results. I still can’t accept what’s happened to me today. I avoid thinking about it  but that’s impossible.\n\nAnathalie cannot forget as she is so often sick.\n\nWe live in a house built by an NGO but it’s not solid. We live off crops from our fields; we don’t have any other source of income. I’m very weak. I’ve not taken any medication to prevent the illnesses that come with HIV. I don’t even know where they distribute these. If it were possible to receive help  I would like priority to be given to my medical needs and to making our house a bit more solid.\n\nSolange’s parents  as well as her seven brothers and sisters were killed at their home in Ngoma  Butare in April. Left to fend for herself at the age of 10  she hid in the fields  then turned to family friends for help. She was taken in by a Hutu woman  married to a soldier  who asked Solange to look after three children.\n\nSeveral weeks later  the soldier returned and urged his wife to flee the advance of the Rwandese Patriotic Army (RPA). Solange was taken with them to Cyangugu where soldiers had set up a camp in a secondary school.\n\nI was raped several times by two men who were guarding the military. I didn’t know them beforehand and I don’t know where they are now. They told me that I was also old enough to be raped like the other Tutsi girls who were there. In fact  I was the youngest of all of them. They told us that our time was up  that we should give in to their desires. These men hurt me. They were violent.\n\nDespite the evident injuries  she is nervous about taking the HIV test.  but fears that she may be infected and that she may have internal injuries which will prevent her from having children. Her neighbours make it difficult for her to meet potential partners.\n\nIf my neighbours find me chatting with someone  they tell him that he’s going to be infected with AIDS because they know everything that happened to me. When I think about all these things  I wonder why I survived.\n\nHer only salvation  she believes  would be a partner who was exceptionally understanding  a prospect about which she is not very optimistic.\n\nI can’t get married unless I find someone I can tell everything to and who will agree to live with me despite that.\n\nEducation: The Harsh Lessons of Indifference\n\nFor the children who escaped the genocide  attending school invariably means overcoming crippling economic problems  disability or ill-health and facing up to haunting memories  prejudice  fear and loneliness. Sometimes the difficulties are insurmountable. Even when children are forced to drop out of school  their belief in the importance of education is rarely extinguished. Most young survivors see education as their only hope for the future  the best chance to give meaning and restore order to their lives. Many are prepared to attend classes although they are hungry and lack any of the necessary equipment  including notebooks and pens. Families will make considerable sacrifices to finance the education of their children; some young orphans have even left school themselves in order to pay the fees of their younger siblings.\n\nBut  whatever their commitment to their studies  once at school  orphans and the children of survivors often have trouble learning. In most schools little effort has been made to accommodate the psychological and practical problems which survivors of the genocide confront. Often they are in the minority and are easily identifiable  whether because of their machete scars  because they are the only children not wearing uniform or because at secondary school their fees are paid for by the FARG. Staff and pupils may make them feel unwelcome at best  and at worst they may tease or harass them  making them feel humiliated and isolated. This was especially true in the years immediately after the genocide Hunger and lack of resources can disrupt their studies and lead to poor grades and low self-esteem. Few will achieve the standards they reached before the genocide. Others are regularly expelled because of their inability to pay school fees  interrupting their education and undermining their confidence. And yet schools may be the only social network with which these children interact. Without parents or extended family  they need additional support from teachers and other pupils. For some it has become their only “home” as they may have nowhere to go in the holidays or  particularly if they live in the countryside  may not be able to afford the journey to visit a relative or friend.\n\nMoreover  the trauma of genocide is forever present in the educational system. Schools were among the most common sites for large-scale massacres in 1994  partly because most parishes include schools in their compound  but also because many people believed that schools would be exempt from attack. It has been estimated that as many as 2000 people were murdered at the primary school of Nyakanyinya in Cyimbogo  Cyangugu on 13 April. Many of them were former pupils of the school. Of those who survived  some stayed on in the school as they did not know where else to go. A number of the girls and women were raped repeatedly. Children as well as adults had their lives cut short in a massacre at St. Joseph’s school in Rwamagana  Kibungo on 16 April. In Gikongoro  90 schoolchildren were trapped at the College of Kibeho. On 7 May  after weeks of torment  all except eight were assassinated. Those who tortured  raped and assassinated them included their schoolmates and teachers. Mass graves lie within sight of many classrooms; they contain the bodies of children who used to sit in those classrooms. Some children are forced to study in the schools where they themselves were injured and their families were murdered.\n\nChildren are painfully aware that some of their teachers—whether in exile  detained in Rwanda or at liberty—were active participants in the genocide. Perhaps of all the professions  teachers—who wield considerable authority—particularly in the countryside  distinguished themselves in the genocide  killing  amongst others  their own pupils and the parents of the children they taught.\n\nPupils also took part in the killings. Many of the leading perpetrators—both men and women—“worked” alongside their children  especially their sons  who often acted as their drivers or as heads of the militia loyal to their parent. Other parents took their children along to intimidate  rob and kill the refugees gathered in churches  schools and hospitals. Some children and young people are absent from educational institutions following accusations that they played an active role in the genocide. They are spending an important part of their formative years behind bars  on charges of genocide. There can also be no doubt that many who have charges to answer are at liberty  in schools  sitting next to survivors of the genocide.\n\nDeath is present in a tangible manner in schools throughout Rwanda. Reminders of former friends and teachers are everywhere. In the words of one child  there are “coffins” in the classroom. Before children can hope to progress at school  this pain and fear must be addressed. Unfortunately  teachers like Charles Hitimana  from Mbogo  who recognise the extent of the difficulties faced by child survivors are comparatively rare. Charles is a survivor himself who lost several of his own children in the killings.\n\nThere are not many children survivors. The majority of them are orphans whose parents died during the genocide. The children rebel against everything. They have mood swings. Sometimes they cry for no apparent reason and sometimes they want to talk all the time and tell many  many stories. Other times they are alone  locked in their solitude. Some are disabled because of their injuries and scars. The children often hurt the others with words or because they can’t control their actions. It is very hard for these poor children and the heavy burden is understandable. Even I am incapable of coping. Life has no meaning anymore.\n\nAnother teacher  Edith  sees a bleak future for these children “without special attention and teachers who like them.”\n\nI have noticed that at school  the children who are survivors are poor and have no uniforms or materials. This is because they are looked after by other survivors  especially old people  who have no-one and nothing left. Most of these children have lost the desire to study.\n\nThe comments from teachers in close contact with survivors in school have hardly changed in the 12 years of African Rights’ research. In mid-1998  Eustache Gatarayiha was teaching at the primary school in sector Rusasa  commune Mugambazi in Greater Kigali.\n\nThe children who’ve survived the genocide need special attention. Deeply distressed by the death of their close relatives  they’ve lost all interest in their studies. Nobody can care for them the way their parents did. They’re living with poor families who can’t afford to buy them uniforms when they need them. Even if these children no longer have to pay the cost of their schooling  they need much more support of various kinds. That might help them to come out of their isolation. Orphans have little interest in their lessons and tend to get poor results. And their new parents aren’t strict enough with them. A boy in the fourth year is an example. He lost both his father and his mother and is living with his grandmother  with five other orphans. The child isn’t being looked after. He’s got chiggers. And his school attendance is poor. Since the genocide  he’s been one of the ones at the bottom of the class. The grandmother he’s living with told me she’s looking after another orphan who’s left school  even though he was only in the first year of primary school.\n\nThe evidence suggests that 12 years on  genocide survivors are particularly prone to troublesome behaviour. Teachers and pupils suggest that their attitudes to education and authority have been affected by their experiences. While many cope admirably with the hardships they face  precisely because they see education as their best hope of survival  others have behavioural difficulties or have simply given up on education and on life in general.\n\nSpeaking not only as a teacher but as a mother and a survivor  Dancille made particular mention of the attitudes of young survivors.\n\nThe young survivors  most of whom are orphans  don’t seem to be aware of the unfortunate position they are in. There is a lot of delinquency. I say this because one of my sons dropped out of school. I think this kind of behaviour is an attempt to cover up their grief and their sadness. They can’t think straight after what they went through during the genocide.\n\nThe adults looking after youngsters who cannot cope face delicate predicaments. They are aware that they cannot give these children the love and support their parents provided. But they are also conscious of the importance of imposing a certain measure of discipline. Careful not to push them beyond the point of no return  they search for a balance that is difficult to establish.\n\nThe testimonies of the youngsters themselves reveal the turmoil in their lives. In mid-1996  Jacqueline Mukayisenga was a pupil at a school in Mugonero  Kibuye. She spoke from personal experience when she said that it was impossible for orphans and other survivors of the genocide at her school to focus on their school work.\n\nThe prefect for discipline at this school told us that the problem for the traumatised children is that they feel alone. Since he is responsible for these children he watches them closely. That is why there is a list of children who don’t even concentrate in class  who are there physically but their thoughts are elsewhere. When people try to get them to pay attention  they reply: “What’s the point of studying?” Sometimes children hide somewhere and cry. When they are asked why they're crying  they calm down without saying a single word. I’m one of these children.\n\nFor Jean de Dieu Furaha  school was a daily encounter with everything he had lost in the genocide  bringing him close to thoughts of suicide. Jean de Dieu  15  is from Gatare in Cyangugu. His parents were killed. His older sister is married and not in a position to help him and his older brother was unemployed. .\n\nDuring the holidays I stay at school because I don’t have anywhere to go. I feel very sad when the exams are over and I see the other pupils wash their clothes  preparing to go on holiday to their parents. At such times I do nothing; I just think of my parents who are dead. I have my older sister  who is very poor. I could go there in the holidays. But I can’t get a ticket to go there; it is in Cyangugu.\n\nAt school the pupils also tease me at study times. Some of the pupils tell me that if they were me  they wouldn’t waste their energy studying because I have no parents or other people who could ask me for my report. When I hear that I even think of committing suicide  because my parents were very necessary to my life.\n\nI cause problems at school because I don’t pay the fees to buy school things and food. If I stay there during the holidays  the school is obliged to feed me; this is another expense for the school. The school head can no longer bear orphans. They have sometimes made us go out of class to ask us to go and get the school fees. In the meantime  the teachers continue to teach the children who have their parents and also to give them tests.\n\nWhen they chase us out of class to go and get the school fees  we stay in school. We refuse to leave because we have nowhere to go. Later  they tell us to go back into the classroom. However we do expect to be thrown out of school at the end of the year.\n\nAt school  each pupil has a bed and a mattress. But I have no mattress. In the evening  when the other pupils revise their subjects  I think about where I am going to sleep because every evening I ask a pupil if I can sleep in their bed. Since the bed is too small  I am forced to stay in the same position during the night  so as not to annoy my fellow-pupil.\n\nApart from the mattress  I always ask the other pupils to give me money to buy pens  soap  notebooks...etc. Some of the pupils give me some  others complain about me  and say: “Are we going to keep giving him money forever?’” Also when we go on walks  I ask other pupils to lend me shoes so that I don’t walk barefoot because we go on long journeys. For sport  other pupils use their slippers. But I do sport bare foot and without sports clothes; I always wear my uniform. In fact  I don’t have a uniform; I only have a shirt and shorts  so I have to wash them at night to wear them in the morning.\n\nBefore the genocide my parents used to look after me. My mother used to give me something to eat as soon as I came back home and my clothes were well-prepared  washed and ironed. My father used to pay my school fees without any problems.\n\nSpeaking in December 2003  Joseph described how his life changed virtually overnight in 1994  forcing him into a life of poverty for which nothing in his 16 years had prepared him. As he could not afford the transport  he was not able to visit his home during the holidays. His poor grades and his lack of stability led to a constant change of schools. In one of the schools  he could not buy his own bed and was forced to share with another student who had TB  which Joseph then contracted.\n\nThis illness was a terrible ordeal for me. I had no-one to visit me and to cheer me up. I couldn’t get the diet which the doctor prescribed for me either at home or at school. I decided to stay at the school because things would only get worse if I went home as those at home are even worse off than we were at school. You can imagine how distressing it was to stay at the school without anyone from your family coming to visit you.\n\nAccording to both teachers and students  trauma is particularly widespread among survivors in secondary school. Joseph’s testimony highlights the many reasons that force young people to feel adrift and tormented.\n\nStudents who were survivors were often sent away because they hadn’t paid their fees. We spent all our time going back and forth. We didn’t have confidence in all the teachers as we couldn’t be certain whether they would be sensitive to our problems. That’s why we didn’t discuss our concerns with just anybody. The teachers had their way of looking at us  and we had our way of judging them according to their behaviour. There was no sense of solidarity from the student body either. For example  during the annual national commemoration of the victims of the genocide  preparing the activities was left to the survivors alone. When you give a testimony on the history of the genocide  it is only the other survivors who take what you say seriously. The other students believe  and say  that we exaggerate in order to make what we say moving. Some are even hostile.\n\nSo at school  we try to hide our feelings from the other students because that is what living side by side demands. The other students also regard the survivors as people who have an easy time and who are spoilt by the State. When they see that the State pays the fees for some of us  they draw the hasty conclusion that they are the victims of injustice since they have to pay the fees themselves. They forget that we once had parents and relatives who could see to our needs without us having to humiliate ourselves by looking for the help of sponsors.\n\nStill  I was able to hold out because I had lived through the worst. And education is the only hope for my future; I can’t give up on it  no matter what the obstacles.\n\nThe presence of others at school at least  said Joseph  provided a distraction.\n\nBut when the holidays approached  I began to think of family problems. And life at home was much harder than at school. I even used to think of staying behind at school during the vacation.\n\nJoseph eventually got the association of student survivors to pay for his entrance to university but said that he finds life as a student “a tough battle to win given my family circumstances.”\n\nEven today  there are times when I spend two or three hours without taking anything in. I don’t have the time to concentrate on my holidays because I’m frequently submerged in family issues which contributes to my failures in class. My older sister doesn’t work; she didn’t work even before the genocide  but then her husband worked and supported them. I also have a younger brother who abandoned primary school just after the genocide. Later  he refused to go back to school  saying he was too old.\n\nCaritas has found the strength to keep going  but she understands the pressures upon young survivors.\n\nEven if a survivor is brilliant he will have discipline problems. It’s true to say that the survivors are undisciplined. It’s obvious why. There are many reasons. Some of the survivors think that anything is acceptable  that they can do what they like no matter where and no matter how because of what they lived through during the genocide. Even though they’re desperate and know the real meaning of life  they don’t control their reactions in their everyday lives. Most of them don’t have any family: no father  mother  elder brother or sister. They may live with distant relatives or alone.\n\nThe survivors often leave before the end of the year. Those who stay on are often expelled. For example out of 67 pupils in this present school year  18 have been expelled for discipline matters and they’re all survivors. Even a well-behaved survivor will get led astray by his friends.\n\nLaurent was so fearful for his security that for a long time he hid the fact that he had been orphaned by the genocide.\n\nI forced myself to be something that I was not.\n\nWithout the FARG  a huge number of survivors would find themselves locked out of educational establishments. But delays in paying schools fees has been a constant criticism leveled at the FARG and has been a source of stress and academic failures for the students concerned  as Laurent pointed out.\n\nAcademic establishments don’t allow them to continue with their studies unless they have paid in full.\n\nKnowing what he endured and saw at secondary school  Laurent commented:\n\nAt university  we are able to manage  somehow. But at secondary school  each survivor is isolated and lost within his own nightmares. Some of them come from families living in abject poverty  others don’t even have families and some live with relatives who treat them badly. Very few live with their own families and in reasonable conditions. We try to keep track of them in our association   but it’s difficult for us to find the time and the means  what with all the other school and family obligations.\n\nWith regard to students supported by the FARG  Thomas underlined that it pays only the fees.\n\nThey often lack lodgings and the necessary equipment  and their morale is always rock bottom. The result is that they don’t make it and are sent away. Then the situation becomes even worse as they blame themselves for not exploiting the possibility that was offered to them  and then they risk becoming unbalanced or thinking of suicide.\n\nWith his mother gainfully employed and a brother and sister to share life with  Thomas considers himself among the lucky ones. But he feels empathy for many of the other members of the Association of Student Survivors of the Genocide.\n\nThey don’t want to desert their studies  the only thing which will give them a future  but nor do they want to turn their backs to the obvious needs of their families. So there they are  torn and without any means. And yet they must absolutely find a way of combining these two heavy responsibilities.\n\nHe worries in particular about what the lack of choice means for girls.\n\nGirls might think of an early marriage  and sometimes they even marry men they know have HIV/AIDS etc…\n\nBurying Loved Ones: Essential Therapy\n\nFor thousands of survivors  Rwanda has become a country of nameless mass graves  into which the bodies of their loved ones fell in heaps. Coming to terms with their loss has been compounded by the failure to find the bodies of relatives  making it difficult to grieve them properly. They have been burned  washed down rivers  dumped and then eaten by dogs and crows  left to rot in toilets or buried anonymously in mass graves. At the same time  and for many years  survivors in the countryside kept stumbling upon skulls and bones. This lack of respect for the dead is an additional source of psychological distress. Not knowing where or how their parents  siblings  grandparents and aunts were killed has made it difficult for both adults and children to express their grief and to close their relationship with the person who has died. For survivors who were not with their families when they died  accepting their death is often impossible. As a result  looking for their remains takes on an added urgency.\n\nCécile Mukarusimbi attended a boarding school in Gitarama but had joined her parents for the holidays in Nyamata. The family ran to Mt. Rebero where Cécile’s mother  four younger sisters and two younger brothers lost their lives.\n\nWhen I was at Nyamata I nearly went mad thinking about the situation I had come from. I had seen my relatives’ naked bodies exposed on the hill. But I hoped that my father  who was in Kigali  was alive. I longed to see him again. He was called Egide Karegeya and worked for the Ministry of Public Works. But he was murdered in Kigali.\n\nCécile knows that her family in Kanzenze was killed by the parents of her friends  making it impossible for her as a youngster on her own to confront them.\n\nI have not found the remains of my family  but the neighbours must know where they left them. Why don’t they tell me? I don’t have the courage to ask them about it; when I see them  I start crying immediately. I’m angry with them  and I would like to speak to them frankly.\n\nMarie-Rose Uwizeyimana was baptised on Easter Sunday  3 April 1994  four days before the genocide began. She was ten at the time. She lived in Mbogo. A week later  their home came under siege and the family scattered. Later  Marie-Rose  the youngest in her family  learned that her parents  four brothers and two sisters died in the neighbouring commune of Shyorongi.\n\nThey were killed far away from me. I don’t know who is responsible. They died at the hands of people who didn’t know them. No-one is in prison for killing the people I loved. I’m the only one who could have them put in prison and I don’t even know who they are. There’s nothing I can do about it.\n\nEvery time we searched the mass graves at Shyorongi  I found nothing. Even if I had found them  what would I have done?\n\nAfter a few moments  Marie-Rose answered her own question.\n\nAt least I would be sure of their deaths.\n\nFor a long time  the uncertainty sustained the hope that they might be alive.\n\nWhen I am at the market  amongst a large crowd  I always think I might find my brothers. If I only knew where their remains had been put  then at least I could go where I could remember them.\n\nWhen I am asleep  in my dreams I imagine myself at home as if no-one was dead. When I wake up I feel sad when I realise that it isn’t true.\n\nWhen I go home to my parents’ house  all I do is cry. I can’t go there alone. I’m afraid of meeting people who I don’t know  especially men  when I’m alone. I always think that they have a machete and that they will kill me.\n\nFor Justin  the possibility that his family’s remains might be in a mass grave somewhere  as opposed to obliteration  is what he holds on to.\n\nI’ve got nothing to remind me of my parents or brothers. I don’t even know where they died. I suppose they lie somewhere in a mass grave. I hope so. Sometimes  I think that perhaps the bones of my loved ones are still lying on a hillside somewhere. My heart aches whenever I think of it.\n\nRégine was 16 in 1994 and was living in Ruhashya in Butare. She left her home on 23 April  together with three young girls  to take refuge on the steep hills of Rubaba. Pursued by the interahamwe  they ran to the sprawling grounds of the agricultural research centre  ISAR in Songa  in the neighbouring commune of Rusatira  where she met up with her parents and four brothers. Her father advised them to disperse  and Régine tried to make her way to Burundi. She was ambushed by militiamen when she reached commune Ntyazo and left for dead in the bushes after a severe beating. She crawled out and joined a group of survivors who managed to cross into Burundi. She spent four years in an orphanage in Nyamata  and since 1998 has lived with another orphan.\n\nI lost more than 20 members of my family. I can’t tell you if they have been buried or not. And not knowing is such a source of sorrow that I can’t sleep. It happens that I will go through a whole week of nightmares  thinking about my father  at the advice he used to give me  telling me to be good towards everyone. Now  there’s only loneliness. I sometimes get into a taxi without knowing where I’m going.\n\nWhat I find the most upsetting is that I don’t know who killed my parents and my brothers. I don’t have a photo of my mother or of my brothers; I only have a passport photo of my father which I got from his bank card.\n\nFear and Mistrust: The Legacy of Betrayal\n\nThe scale  speed and brutality with which genocide was accomplished in Rwanda—a country lacking in the modern infrastructure and technology of mass death—is a tragic monument to the ability of a State to divide its people  severing bonds which had intertwined people and communities for decades. In part  the genocide owed its efficiency to the direct involvement or tacit collusion of many relatives  friends  neighbours and colleagues of its victims.\n\nThe mechanisms varied by which the perpetrators convinced the population to turn their backs upon those with whom they had formerly lived side by side  but promises to disinherit the Tutsis of their land  homes and belongings  the threat of financial penalties  intimidation and propaganda caused many to succumb to the message of hatred. This betrayal has robbed survivors of their loved ones  their communities  their homes and possessions and of any sense of security. Their ability to trust even those closest to them has  in many cases  been permanently destroyed. Tutsis were also betrayed by people in positions of authority and responsibility to whom they had looked for protection—priests  nuns  doctors  local government officials  nurses and  amongst others  teachers. It will undoubtedly take the Rwandese nation several generations to recover from the social and psychological consequences of this mass betrayal.\n\nGoretti Murebwayire feels so cut off from her former life that she does not feel the need for new friends. What  she wonders  would they talk about? Goretti  17  lived in Gikoro Greater Kigali. She experienced the genocide in Rwamagana  Kibungo  at the home of her grandmother. When Kigali fell on 4 July  her thoughts focused on finding her family in Gikoro  cellule Bwiza.\n\nI made myself go home to Gikoro. I wanted to see my family and to tell them about my miraculous survival at Rwamagana. I thought that they would be worrying about me  thinking I was dead. I didn’t think that they had been killed. My heart assured me that they were there  and that I was going to see them and talk to them. When I arrived in Gikoro  I found the opposite: my family had been wiped out in April.\n\nHer parents  four sisters and brother had died; she found virtually no trace of the extended family.\n\nMy uncles and cousins who lived in Duha had all been killed. The burnt bodies were still there  at my uncle Gakire’s place. They had been shut in his house  killed by hand grenades and then burned with petrol. My aunt came from Uganda here to Gikoro where her brothers and sisters had been killed. She found only me.\n\nGoretti refused to return to the home of her surviving grandmother in Rwamagana.\n\nI didn’t want to leave before burying my family.\n\nAlthough only 13 at the time  Goretti’s decision to settle in Bwiza was a gesture of defiance.\n\nI wanted to show the people who had killed my family that I was there. My aunt stayed with me. She had three children whose father was Ugandan. We formed a family. We cultivated the fields for food.\n\nBut after three years of sharing her life with her new family  Goretti found herself on her own.\n\nIn December 1997 my aunt  who had become like a father and mother to me  died of an unknown illness. She was all I had. After her death  her children returned to Uganda. I was alone again. A cousin has come to live with me  because I couldn’t stay alone. He often works in his fields in the day time and comes back in the evening. Sometimes he doesn’t come back and I’m afraid of spending the night alone.\n\nGoretti  who had been in the fifth form of primary school in 1994  had to abandon school to help her aunt with farming “in order to survive.” The task of burying the family’s remains had not been completed when her aunt died; Goretti continued and completed the burial in May 1998.\n\nUnable to comprehend why their neighbours and the local population turned on her family  Goretti has withdrawn into herself and lives in isolation and in fear of her own life.\n\nMy parents did nothing to deserve death. They were on good terms with the neighbours. Now I’m continually afraid of the people in this region who killed my father  my mother and all the children  even the youngest. They might also kill me. I never go to call on them  and they never call on me. I have no friends. Most of the young girls of my age have fathers and brothers in prison because of the genocide. I don’t need friends in any case. What for? What would we talk about? My life is miserable. Nothing makes me happy. I no longer fear death like I did before the genocide. Death would be welcome  because then I could join my parents wherever the dead go.\n\nAt the age of ten  Uwayisenga was bewildered by the ease and speed with which a family friend turned into an executioner.\n\nWhen I saw the militia  I ran. One militiaman came up behind me. He was a strong man and he caught me. I was astonished. I realised that he was a friend. His name was Hazigama and he was from Rwankuba. Before the genocide  Hazigama used to come to our house everyday. He farmed my father’s fields and he received a salary. He received his salary on time and we never had any problems. We used to play with him and he was like a brother to us even though we were not from the same family.\n\nWith the innocence of childhood  Uwayisenga turned to logic to make sense of a world beyond her comprehension.\n\nHazigama was just about to kill me. I asked him why when I had done nothing to hurt him. I begged him to take pity on me. He said nothing but just hit me on the head with a machete. He had bits of wood in his hand which he stuck into my face. When he thought I was dead  he left.\n\nTowards a Better Future?\n\nOnly a small number of people were saved from genocide in 1994; in the intervening years  few have been protected from its consequences. In their desolation and despair  these youngsters echo each other. Their words  which bear witness to a series of personal tragedies  are a prolonged collective indictment of the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide. But they are also evidence of unacceptable neglect on the part of both national and international actors over the past 12 years.\n\nIn the aftermath of this appalling crime against humanity  a clear rejection of the attempt to dehumanize a people was  and is still  needed. This requires both justice and a comprehensive attempt at the rehabilitation of survivors  restoring dignity to a people who have lost all else. The alternative is to remain bystanders to a slow torture as genocide crimes continue to destroy minds  bodies and spirits.""]",african right n ndiscussion paper april n na wound generation n nthe

A look at Rwandas genocide helps explain why ordinary people kill ...,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rwanda-genocide-psychology-murder,['A string of state-directed  targeted mass killings left a bloody stain on the 20th century. A genocide more recent than the Holocaust is providing new insights into why some people join in such atrocities.\n\nAdolf Hitler’s many accomplices in his campaign to exterminate Jews throughout Europe have justifiably attracted the attention of historians and social scientists. But a 100-day spasm of unprecedented violence in 1994 that wiped out about three-quarters of the ethnic Tutsi population in the African nation of Rwanda has the potential to reveal much about how mass killings unfold at ground level.\n\nThere is no guarantee that a better  although inevitably incomplete  understanding of why certain members of Rwanda’s majority Hutu population nearly eliminated a Tutsi minority will prevent future large-scale slaughters. The research is worth the effort  though  especially in a 21st century already marked by massacres of hundreds of thousands of people in western Sudan’s Darfur region and in Syria.\n\nResearchers have an advantage in Rwanda. When hostilities ended  Rwanda’s government gathered extensive data on genocide victims and suspected perpetrators through a national survey. And local courts tried more than 1 million cases of alleged involvement in the violence  making the case documents available to researchers.\n\nGenocide studies have often split offenders into organizers — mainly political and community leaders — and “ordinary men” who kill out of blind obedience to central or local authorities and hatred of those deemed enemies. But the extensive data from Rwanda tell a different story: An individual’s willingness to take part in genocidal violence depends on many personal and social factors that influence whether and how deeply a person participates  says sociologist and Rwanda genocide researcher Hollie Nyseth Brehm of Ohio State University in Columbus.\n\nNyseth Brehm’s findings may not apply to some of Rwanda’s most avid killers  who eluded capture and fled the country as soon as hostilities stopped. But when it comes to the ordinary citizens swept up in the deadly campaign  involvement was not primarily about following political leaders’ orders to eliminate Tutsis.\n\nNew reports by Nyseth Brehm and others fuel skepticism about the popular idea that regular folks tend to do as they’re told by authorities. And a fresh look at a famous 1960s psychology study adds further doubt that people will blindly follow orders to harm or kill others.\n\n20 percent Proportion of Hutu men who seriously injured or killed at least once in Rwanda’s genocide\n\nIn reality  only about 20 percent of Hutu men  an estimated 200 000  seriously injured or killed at least one person during the genocidal outbreak  estimates Rwanda genocide researcher Omar McDoom of the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\n“Why did four in five Hutu men not engage in the killing?” McDoom asks. That puzzle goes against the ordinary man thesis that “implies there are no individual differences in genocide participation ” he says. He suspects participation hinged on personal motivations  such as wanting to defend Rwanda from enemies or make off with a Tutsi neighbor’s possessions. Social circumstances  such as living in high-violence areas or having friends or family members who had already murdered Tutsis  probably played a role too. Nyseth Brehm agrees.\n\nLocal triggers\n\nGenocides often fester before exploding. In Rwanda  Tutsi rebels attacked the Hutu-led government and set off a civil war several years before mass killings started. A turning point came when unidentified forces killed Rwanda’s president  shooting down his plane on April 6  1994. Over the next three months  the government orchestrated a massacre of Tutsis and any Hutus deemed friendly or helpful to Tutsis. Most scholars place the death toll at around 800 000  although estimates range from 500 000 to 1.2 million. Bands of Hutus scoured the countryside for their sworn enemies. Killings took place at roadblocks and in raids on churches  schools and other community facilities. Hutu women killed on a much smaller scale than men did  although they often aided those involved in the carnage.\n\nIn many parts of Rwanda  local authorities appointed by the national government recruited Hutu men into groups that burned and looted homes of their Tutsi neighbors  killing everyone they encountered  says political scientist Scott Straus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In his 2016 book Fundamentals of Genocide and Mass Atrocity Prevention  Straus describes how Rwandan recruitment efforts coalesced into a killing machine. Politicians  business people  soldiers and others encouraged Hutu farmers to kill an enemy described as “cockroaches” in need of extermination. Similarly  Nazis portrayed Jews as cockroaches and vermin.\n\nDespite the Rwandan state’s best efforts to encourage nationwide Tutsi annihilation  local conditions shaped how the 1994 genocide unfolded  Nyseth Brehm reported in February in Criminology. She looked at 142 of the nation’s 145 municipalities  known as communes. Some experienced as few as 71 killings  while in others  as many as 54 700 people were murdered  she found.\n\nCommunes with the fewest killings were those that had the highest marriage and employment rates  Nyseth Brehm says. In those settings  mainly farming communities where people knew and trusted each other  most citizens valued a peaceful status quo and discouraged a descent into mass killing  she suspects.\n\nStory continues after map\n\nDeath’s geography Murder rates during a 100-day genocide varied greatly across Rwanda’s municipalities  or communes. A national survey indicated that areas of high violence (darker colors) had low levels of marriage and employment but high levels of education. H. Nyseth Brehm/Criminology 2017\n\nCuriously  violence was worse in areas with the largest numbers of educated people. That points to the effectiveness of anti-Tutsi teachings in Rwandan schools  Nyseth Brehm suggests.\n\nHer study relied on data from a postgenocide survey  published in 2004 by Rwanda’s government  intended to document every person killed during the atrocity. Citizens throughout Rwanda told interviewers about individuals in their communities who had been killed during the outburst of slaughter. Reported and confirmed deaths were checked against records of human remains linked to the 1994 genocide. Comparisons were also made to Rwanda’s 1991 census.\n\nHowever  any data on killings during mass violence  including from the Rwandan survey  will be incomplete  Nyseth Brehm cautions. So she also analyzed data from 1 068 192 genocide-related cases tried in local Rwandan courts from 2002 to 2012. Of particular note  although most nongenocidal murders in Rwanda are carried out by men in their 20s  the average age of accused genocide perpetrators was 34.7 years old  Nyseth Brehm reported in the November 2016 Criminology.\n\nHutu men in their 30s joined the genocidal fray as a way to fulfill adult duties by defending their communities against an outside threat  she suggests. Preliminary analyses show that perpetrators tended to cluster in families; if one of several brothers killed Tutsis  the others were far more likely to follow suit.\n\nAdditional scouring of court data indicated that Rwandans who had siblings convicted of genocide killings were especially likely to have murdered Tutsis themselves. In earlier interviews of 130 Rwandans  some who had killed Tutsis and others who hadn’t  McDoom similarly found that perpetrators tended to cluster in families.\n\nMissing murderers\n\nUnfortunately  the Rwandan genocide’s most prolific players have eluded both the law and science  says political scientist Cyanne Loyle of Indiana University Bloomington. Investigators have so far interviewed only a handful of the powerful “big fish” who orchestrated the genocide  plus several hundred people tried and imprisoned for genocide participation. Survey and court data are limited to killers who either stayed in Rwanda after atrocities ended or were caught trying to flee the country.\n\nBut perpetrators with the most blood on their hands traveled in bands  wiping out tens of thousands of people at a time before hiding abroad  Loyle says. For instance  local officials lured large numbers of Tutsis to a school near the town of Murambi  where Hutu militias used machine guns  explosives and other weapons to kill more than 40 000 people in just three days.\n\n“Scholars have studied Rwandans who killed on the sidelines while a larger and deadlier campaign was under way ” Loyle says. “They have mistaken a sideshow for the main event.”\n\nPerpetrators of colossal atrocities at Murambi and elsewhere were less powerful than the government’s genocide masterminds  Loyle says. These “murderers in the middle ” however  were better equipped and far more effective at killing than common folk who got caught up in events  she contends.\n\nThere are no good estimates of how many members of large-scale killing squads escaped Rwanda and now live elsewhere. From 15 000 to 22 000 members of the Rwandan army and local militia groups were at large in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  near Rwanda’s border  in January 2003  according to a report by the International Crisis Group  a nonprofit organization.\n\nNyseth Brehm acknowledges the difficulty of accounting for genocide perpetrators who eluded justice. She and others  including Straus  have interviewed genocide offenders who stayed in Rwanda  often imprisoned for their crimes. Many of those who fled must have traveled in groups that murdered on a grand scale  she says. Those mass killers represent crucial missing data on who participates in genocide  and for what reasons.\n\nStory continues after table\n\nPerp hierarchy Political scientist Cyanne Loyle splits participants in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide into three groups. “Ordinary men” had a range of reasons for killing others. But ethnic and ideological zealots  often trained as killers  carried out most of the bloodshed in the name of power players who instigated and coordinated from a distance. Type of perpetrator Type of violence Number of people killed Motivations Ordinary men Personal killings  revenge  neighbor-on-neighbor violence  ordered by superiors Minimal Fear  greed  family and friend influences Murderers in the middle Organized  mobile killing squads Extreme Ideological  political advancement “Big fish” organizers Coordination of mass killings Little direct participation in violence Maintain and enhance power Source: C.E. Loyle and C. Davenport\n\nVicious virtue\n\nIn interviews by Nyseth Brehm  McDoom and others  perpetrators listed many reasons for joining the 1994 killing spree — hatred of Tutsis  a perceived need to protect nation and family  a desire to claim a neighbor’s property or a decision to join a suddenly popular cause  to name a few. Blind obedience to brutal leaders was far from the only reason cited.\n\nThat finding conflicts with the late psychologist Stanley Milgram’s interpretation of his famous “obedience to authority” experiments. Milgram described those trials  in which volunteers were told to administer increasingly intense shocks to another person  as a demonstration of people’s frequent willingness to follow heinous commands. He saw the experiments as approximating the more extreme situations in which Germans had participated in the Holocaust.\n\nVolunteers in “obedience to authority” experiments gave what they thought were shocks to “learners ” such as the seated man above. Most volunteers did so because they supported the scientific project  researchers now say. © 1968 BY STANLEY MILGRAM  © RENEWED 1993 BY ALEXANDRA MILGRAM. FROM THE FILM OBEDIENCE DISTRIBUTED BY ALEXANDER STREET PRESS\n\nOn closer inspection  though  Milgram’s study aligns closely with what’s known about Rwandan genocide perpetrators  says S. Alexander Haslam  a psychologist at the University of Queensland in Australia.\n\nIn Milgram’s experiments  as in Rwanda and Nazi Germany  “those willing to harm others were not so much passive ciphers as motivated instruments of a collective cause ” Haslam says. “They perceived themselves as acting virtuously and doing good things.”\n\nAlthough Milgram’s tests upset some volunteers  most participants identified with his scientific mission to understand human behavior and wanted to prove themselves as worthy of the project  Haslam and psychologist Stephen Reicher of the University of St. Andrews in Fife  Scotland  conclude in a research review scheduled to appear in the 2017 Annual Review of Law and Social Science.\n\nMilgram conducted 23 obedience experiments with New Haven  Conn.  residents in 1961 and 1962 (SN: 9/21/13  p. 30). Most attention has focused on only one of those experiments. Volunteers designated as “teachers” were asked by an experimenter to continue upping the intensity of what they thought were electric shocks to a “learner” — who was actually in league with Milgram — who erred time and again on a word-recall test. Through screams  shouts and eventually dead silence from the learner  26 of 40 volunteers  or 65 percent  administered shocks all the way to a maximum of 450 volts.\n\nBut experiments that undermined participants’ identification with the scientific mission lowered their willingness to deliver the harshest shocks  Haslam and Reicher say. Fewer volunteers shocked to the bitter end if  for instance  the study was conducted in an office building rather than a university laboratory or if the experimenter was not physically present. An analysis of data available from 21 of the 23 experiments finds that 43.6 percent of 740 volunteers shocked learners to the limit.\n\nStanley Milgram’s volunteers “perceived themselves as acting virtuously and doing good things.” — S. Alexander Haslam\n\nParticipants were most compliant when an experimenter encouraged them to continue shocking for the sake of the experiment (by saying  “The experiment requires that you continue”)  the psychologists add. Participants never followed the order: “You have no choice  you must continue.”\n\nMilgram’s archives at Yale University contain letters and survey responses from former participants reporting high levels of support for Milgram’s project and for science in general. Many former volunteers told Milgram that they administered shocks out of a duty to collaborate on what they viewed as important research  even if it caused them distress at the time. Still  Milgram’s recruits often admitted having had suspicions during the experiments that learners were not really being zapped.\n\nMilgram was right that his experiments applied to real-world genocides  Haslam concludes  but erred in assuming that obedience to authority explained his results. From Milgram’s laboratory to Rwanda’s killing squads and Nazi concentration camps  orders to harm others are carried out by motivated followers  not passive conformists  he asserts.\n\nIf anything  that makes genocide all the more horrifying.\n\nThis story appears in the August 19  2017 issue of Science News with the headline: “Duty Bound Killings: Rwandan data offer a glipse of what drives

Music to kill to: Rwandan genocide survivors remember RTLM,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/6/7/music-to-kill-to-rwandan-genocide-survivors-remember-rtlm,['Following the arrest of genocide suspect Felicien Kabuga  survivors reflect on the role of the radio station he funded.\n\nWhen Felicien Kabuga  an 84-year-old former businessman from Rwanda  was arrested in France on May 16  the world was reminded of one of the darkest chapters in recent history.\n\nDuring 100 days in 1994  at least 800 000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.\n\nKabuga  once one of the wealthiest men in Rwanda  was the co-founder and funder of Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM)  a station established in 1993 that regularly called Tutsis “cockroaches” and encouraged people to “cut down the tall trees”  in reference to Tutsis. Once the genocide started  the station broadcast the names of people to be killed and information about where they could be found.\n\nIn 1997  the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)  an international court established by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to judge people responsible for the genocide  indicted Kabuga on seven criminal charges including genocide.\n\nHere  three survivors share their stories and reflect upon the significance of Kabuga’s arrest.\n\nClaver Irakoze: ‘We prayed to die softly’\n\nMy family lived in Kabgayi  a town 60km south of the capital Kigali that is well known for its Catholic cathedral  school and hospital. My father was a secondary school teacher and my mother a primary school teacher. I have two brothers and two sisters.\n\nI was 11 years old when the genocide against the Tutsis started in April 1994. But I remember my family and friends being targeted by the government from as early as 1990.\n\nWhen the multi-party system started in Rwanda in 1991  new parties started to recruit members.\n\nPeople from different political parties came to our home and asked: What party do you belong to? The desire to know where each one belonged was so important. But my parents did not join any party.\n\nAs the political turmoil evolved  this recruitment process became an indirect way of mapping the political affiliation of Tutsi families. A response like “I don’t belong to any party” could easily be interpreted as support for the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)  which was fighting the government.\n\nOne of my first experiences at school was being asked what ethnic group I belonged to. When some of us said we did not know  our teacher asked us to come back the next day with an answer.\n\nSongs of hate\n\nIn July 1993  RTLM was created. It was a turning point.\n\nWe had very few radio stations before then. There was Radio Rwanda  the national radio station which was controlled by the government  and a few other radio stations that could be heard by short wave.\n\nThere were some radical journalists at Radio Rwanda  but there was still a degree of moderation. RTLM  on the other hand  was directly propagandistic. It had been created for that purpose.\n\nWe listened to RTLM. We listened to learn – to know what was developing.\n\nI remember RTLM broadcasting songs conveying hatred and demonising the Tutsi. The songs would openly call for our extermination. Political slogans were translated into song and young people were mobilised into youth movements. These youth movements were key to executing the genocide.\n\nAs a child I was scared. I was scared by what I saw in my parents. They lacked hope. They were defenceless. Now that I have children myself  I realise how difficult it is if you have no hope.\n\nAnd then the genocide started\n\nGenocide does not come quickly. The dehumanisation of the Tutsis began in the years before 1994. Everything from getting a job to your freedom of movement was linked to your ID  which stated your ethnic group.\n\nAs a young boy  my life consisted of school then home and church on Sundays. My last memories from before the genocide are of my family preparing for Easter.\n\nEaster was on April 3. I remember RTLM broadcasting that something big was going to happen and that the National Army should be on standby to protect the country. But we were used to such messages.\n\nThen the genocide started.\n\nOn April 6  the plane carrying the president  Juvenal Habyarimana  was shot down killing him and all the others on board. The chaos started immediately. It was like there was a plan. Roadblocks were put in place within minutes of the crash. By the following morning  people were being stopped at them by both the army and armed fighters and asked for their ID.\n\nJournalists from Radio Rwanda told people to stay at home until given further instructions.\n\nOn April 7  I heard people screaming on the hills that surrounded our area. That evening I could see homes on fire.\n\nI observed my parents’ fear. For them  it was their second experience of such chaos. They had fled to neighbouring Burundi in 1973 after Habyarimana took over in a coup  and Tutsis were attacked by crowds of Hutus.\n\nFor them  it was a reminder of that time.\n\nAfter learning about the death of the president  my mum told us: “We are dead.” My parents could no longer contain their fear.\n\nNeighbour against neighbour\n\nSome days after the crash  a Hutu neighbour came to warn us. “I’ve known you for long and I don’t want to kill you ” he said. But he did want to be the first to loot our house.\n\nAfter the genocide  we learned that our neighbour had not only looted our house  but destroyed it.\n\nNeighbours were pitted against neighbours. This is what a “genocide of proximity” means.\n\nWe fled to St Joseph’s College  the school where my dad taught.\n\nThousands of people were heading to the cathedral  which was next to the school. So we joined the crowd – but just before reaching the cathedral  we turned in the direction of the school instead.\n\nWhen we first reached it  there were just four or five families there – all relations of people who worked in the school.\n\nWe stayed in the school dormitories because the students were not there. There were priests living in one wing of the school  which made us feel protected.\n\nIn the days that followed  many people tried to reach the cathedral because they  too  thought they would be protected. But the killers allowed people to go there because it would make them easier to kill.\n\nSoon  the school was full  every classroom  dormitory  even the playground. There were thousands of people. Kabgayi as a site hosted up to 50 000 Tutsi refugees.\n\nThe soldiers came with lists\n\nIn the following days  government soldiers entered the main gate of the school. They came with lists of names.\n\nThey took them far away before killing them.\n\nAlmost every day  they came.\n\nAll we could do was pray. We prayed to die softly and to go to heaven. People were negotiating over how they should be killed – that was the level of trauma.\n\nThere was an outbreak of cholera and other diseases in the school. You can imagine the lack of hygiene with so many people.\n\nHunger also killed many people. The Red Cross occasionally brought us biscuits to eat – two or three biscuits had to last you several days.\n\nOne day  my grandfather was brought to the school by someone who had found him hiding in his house. He had been badly wounded by machetes. He died in front of my mother  who could do nothing to help him.\n\nThen  on April 28  the soldiers took my father.\n\nHunger and liberation\n\nWe were liberated by RPF soldiers on June 2. It was miraculous. Most of those who survived long enough to be rescued were children  the elderly and the sick.\n\nBut locked in the school  we had not realised the extent of the destruction outside.\n\nEscorted by a few RPF soldiers  we marched from Kabgayi to a place in the south called Ruhango  which had already been captured by the RPF. We saw dead bodies on every street.\n\nMy mother  who was extremely sick by the time we were liberated  died two weeks later.\n\nSo when the genocide ended in July  my siblings and I could rejoice at surviving  but had to face a future without our parents.\n\nWe were starving. We had no home to return to. But we tried to be resilient. The love we felt for one another helped us to survive when we had nothing.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nI value the fact that the ICTR was put in place. It was a big milestone in fighting injustice. But it completed fewer than 100 cases. How can you tell me that such a tribunal has done enough?\n\nIn particular  I do not think it has done enough to prosecute church people who were involved in the genocide.\n\nWe have a huge responsibility to transmit the history of what happened. The book I wrote for children  That child is me  was an attempt to connect to my children and to tell them what happened to me. Not just the pain and the hardship but also the lessons. I feel obliged to spend the rest of my life teaching the younger generation about the past and about the value of life.\n\nWhat we endured will never leave us. Once you have experienced genocide it becomes like a permanent marker on you. It is there with you in times of sadness and times of joy. You carry it with you until you die.\n\nHonore Gatera: ‘Music they could dance to as they killed’\n\nI was 13 years old in 1994.\n\nOnly a few wealthy families in the capital  Kigali  had televisions then. So  after the RTLM was created in 1993  everyone listened to it. I had a small  old radio that I listened to it on.\n\nDemonstrations by the youth wings of the political parties became worse after it started broadcasting. RTLM quickly became more and more propagandistic.\n\nFamous commentators had programmes on RTLM. The Belgian presenter Georges Ruggiu had a show in French. After the genocide  the ICTR sentenced him to 12 years in prison for incitement to commit genocide.\n\nBefore April 1994  RTLM sent messages about how the Hutus must protect themselves against the “snakes” and the “cockroaches”  meaning the Tutsis. There were already some killings taking place. People my family knew in another region of Rwanda were killed.\n\nWe heard about Habyarimana’s death on the 6am news on RTLM. The radio immediately said the “cockroaches” shot down the plane. People felt desperate. They were saying “it’s over”.\n\nI remember the screams  as people broke into homes and burned them down.\n\nAll the while  the radio kept broadcasting messages like “search for cockroaches – make sure you find them”. The radio played music the militiamen could dance to as they killed.\n\nBeatrice Uwera: ‘We are still standing’\n\nIn 1994  I was 24 years old. My father worked in the Ministry of Agriculture. My mother was a teacher.\n\nI remember the first day the RTLM broadcast. The mood was scary. Every day  it stirred hatred.\n\nMy parents knew what was to come. They remembered the killings that had taken place in the 1970s. But they also had a feeling that we could not escape. They preferred to just listen and keep quiet  because there was no alternative.\n\nEarly in the morning of April 7  at about 5am  I listened to the radio and heard that the president had been killed. I told my parents what happened and for the first time  my father told me: “We are finished. This is the end.”\n\nHe knew we were going to be killed.\n\nThe genocide started immediately.\n\nThe army and armed fighters went from house to house with lists. Lists of all the Tutsis.\n\nThey were using new machetes  guns  hoes  all kinds of instruments to kill people.\n\nI had four siblings. By the grace of God  four of us survived. Our Hutu neighbours protected us. They moved us from our house to theirs and hid us. Then  they helped us reach Saint Paul Church in Kigali.\n\nMy older sister  who did not live with us  was killed with her family.\n\nWe reached Saint Paul at the end of April. There were more than 2 000 of us there. The priest at the church was Father Celestin Hakizimana. He was very clever about protecting us; he would give food and money to the militias to stop them from killing us. He tried his best  but sometimes they would still take men and boys to kill.\n\nBecause there were so many people at the church  I was not so scared of being killed in a large group. My fear was of being killed alone.\n\nTomorrow they will kill us  we would think. Each day we waited for them to come.\n\nThen  on June 17  the RPF rescued us.\n\nReturning home\n\nWe found our house still standing. Only the windows and roof had been removed.\n\nBut Kigali was filled with the smell of dead bodies. It was catastrophic. More than 200 people in my own family had been killed. In my mother’s family  there were eight siblings. Only one survived. We had to begin again from zero. The country had to start from scratch.\n\nI always think of those people who were killed. I have four children. I try to explain to them when I can. But sometimes I cannot.\n\nRwanda tried to recover from the genocide. People are living in peace. We are not scared. You can walk  you can go out  you can live where you want. We are working together.\n\nWe are still good friends with the Hutu neighbours who protected us. We visit each other. We help each other. It is a very strong relationship. You cannot describe how strong it is.\n\nWe wish that Kabuga could be tried in Rwanda. It would be good to show him that we are still standing. But we are happy that at least he has been caught.'],follow arrest genocide suspect felicien kabuga survivor reflect role radio station fund n nwhen felicien kabuga year old former businessman rwanda

Rwanda opposition leader says allys killing was act of intimidation ...,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/25/rwanda-opposition-leader-victoire-ingabire-ally-killing-act-intimidation,['An opposition leader in Rwanda has said the murder this week of a senior official in her party was an attempt to intimidate those trying to enter politics to challenge the veteran president  Paul Kagame.\n\nSylidio Dusabumuremyi  the national coordinator of the FDU-Inkingi party  was stabbed to death at his workplace  a canteen at a health centre in southern Rwanda  by two unidentified attackers who arrived by motorbike.\n\nVictoire Ingabire  the party’s leader  said Monday’s attack was aimed at preventing her party from winning official recognition.\n\n“They want to prevent me from creating an opposition party … This killing has no other implications other than intimidating Rwandans from participating in politics of their country ” she said.\n\nKagame won a landslide victory in 2017 elections  securing a third term in office with 99% of the vote.\n\nThe 61-year-old has garnered international praise for the stability and economic development he has achieved in Rwanda since the 1994 genocide  when an estimated 800 000 people were killed  but he has also been accused of running an authoritarian  one-party state.\n\nPaul Kagame speaking at the United Nations general assembly this week. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAuthorities in Rwanda said they were investigating the attack and two people had been arrested.\n\n“Investigations continue to arrest other suspects and establish the motive behind the murder ” the Rwanda investigation bureau said in a statement on social media.\n\nThe murder was the latest in a series of attacks that have targeted opposition figures inside and outside Rwanda.\n\nAmnesty International said the killing of Dusabumuremyi followed numerous suspicious attacks and was “extremely alarming”.\n\nIngabire  50  returned to Rwanda to launch an opposition political movement in 2010 after 16 years exile in the Netherlands  but was jailed before she could contest the election. She then served much of a 15-year sentence on terrorism charges  which she says were politically motivated.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Kigali as she arrived at a hearing in the case of nine other people from her party who face terrorism-related charges  Ingabire called on security services to “do something about those killings and protect the opposition members as all Rwandans”.\n\nDusabumuremyi was at least the second of Ingabire’s aides to be killed this year.\n\nOn 15 July 2019  Eugène Ndereyimana  another member of FDU-Inkingi  was reported missing by his colleagues when he failed to show up for a meeting in Nyagatare in Rwanda’s Eastern province  and in March the body of Ingabire’s spokesman was found on the edge of the Gishwati forest in March after he disappeared while travelling to visit his parents.\n\nLast year Boniface Twagirimana  FDU-Inkingi’s vice-president  was reported to have escaped from Mpanga prison  a maximum-security jail in the southern Nyanza district  but has not been seen since. Human rights campaigners say the circumstances of his alleged escape suggest he may have been abducted and killed.\n\nKagame’s government came under international scrutiny in 2014 when the president’s former spy chief Patrick Karegeya was found strangled in a luxury hotel in Johannesburg on New Year’s Day.\n\nKaregeya took charge of Rwanda’s foreign intelligence services for a decade  until he fell into disgrace. He was jailed twice  in 2005 and 2006.\n\nSouth African prosecutors said they found “close links” between the murder suspects and Kagame’s government. Rwanda has always denied the allegations.\n\nSouth Africa has asked Rwanda to extradite two men suspected of murdering Karegeya  in a move likely to sour relations between the two countries.\n\nProtesters seen earlier this year outside the Rwandan embassy in Pretoria  South Africa  calling for an investigation into the killing of Patrick Karegeya. Photograph: Alexander Joe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKagame forcefully denied any human rights abuses in Rwanda earlier this year  calling criticism “absolute rubbish” and “ridiculous”.\n\n“You [in Europe] really need to stop this superiority complex nonsense about human rights ” Kagame told France24. “You think you’re the only ones who respect human rights  and all others it’s about violating human rights. No  we have fought for human rights and freedoms of our people much better  and more than anyone including you people who keep talking about this nonsense.”\n\nIn September last year  2 000 prisoners were released  including Ingabire. Human rights organisations welcomed this  saying it showed that “Rwanda may be turning a new leaf”  but said the arrests  executions  disappearances and torture would have to end to prove that the change was meaningful.\n\nDespite some discontent over unemployment and other domestic issues  and a controversial reputation overseas  Kagame appears to be genuinely popular in Rwanda.\n\nSome observers have questioned the reliability of the economic statistics showing growth.

No details of the suspects were given.\n\nThe grenade exploded near a busy bus terminal in Giporoso  Remera  a suburb of Kigali.\n\nBadege said the police cannot at the moment figure out the motive of those who threw the grenade  but were not ruling out that the attack was designed to cause instability.\n\n“So far two people are dead and among the 28 who sustained injuries  10 are critically injured and hospitalized ” Badege told Reuters.\n\n“This particular type was a hand grenade. It went off at around 7 p.m. Kigali time at Giporoso near the bus park.\n\n“It could be an isolated incident  but we can’t say it was by accident because someone was definitely moving with this grenade.

Rwandan genocide survivor is friends with man who killed her child ...,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2598189/Incredible-story-Rwandan-genocide-survivor-survived-machete-attack-friends-man-killed-child.html,"[""'I watched him kill my baby daughter but I forgave him': Incredible story of the Rwandan genocide survivor who lost her nine-month-old baby in machete attack... and who now forgives her daughter's killer\n\nAlice Mukarurinda was 25 when she was attacked and left for dead by her former classmate  Emmanuel Ndayisaba\n\nAlthough Mrs Mukarurinda survived  her baby daughter who was just nine months old was murdered\n\nNow the pair have been reunited and Mrs Mukarurinda has forgiven the man who attacked her and killed her child\n\nGenocide survivors have been telling their stories ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 100 day massacre tomorrow\n\nAmong them is Jean Marie Vianney  now 64  whose wife and six children were murdered by the Interahamwe\n\nAnother is Aloys Rwamasirabo whose family died when militia bulldozed a church in which they were sheltering\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe lost her baby daughter and her right hand to a manic killing spree. He wielded the machete that took both. Yet today  despite coming from opposite sides of an unspeakable shared past  Alice Mukarurinda and Emmanuel Ndayisaba are friends.\n\nShe is the treasurer and he the vice president of a group that builds simple brick houses for genocide survivors. They live near each other and shop at the same market.\n\nTheir story of ethnic violence  extreme guilt and  to some degree  reconciliation is the story of Rwanda today  20 years after its Hutu majority killed more than one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.\n\n\n\nForgiveness: Emmanuel Ndayisiba was a member of the Interahamwe and murdered Alice Mukurinda's baby daughter. Despite that  she has forgiven him\n\nSurvivor: During the same attack  Emmanuel cut off Alice's right hand using a machete and left her bleeding and unconscious in a swamp to die\n\nForgiveness: Emmanuel says he has felt guilty about what happened ever since and has joined a Hutu group that encourages other genocidaires to ask for forgiveness\n\nThe Rwandan government is still accused by human rights groups of holding an iron grip on power  stifling dissent and killing political opponents. But even critics give President Paul Kagame credit for leading the country toward a peace that seemed all but impossible two decades ago.\n\n\n\n'Whenever I look at my arm I remember what happened ' says Alice  a mother of five with a deep scar on her left temple where Emanuel sliced her with a machete. As she speaks  Emmanuel - the man who killed her baby - sits close enough that his left hand and her right stump sometimes touch.\n\nTomorrow  Rwanda marks the 20th anniversary of the beginning of 100 days of bloody mayhem. But the genocide was in the making for decades  fuelled by hate speech  discrimination  propaganda and the training of death squads. Hutus had come to resent Tutsis for their greater wealth and what they saw as oppressive rule.\n\nRwanda is the most densely populated country in mainland Africa  slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland but with a population of more than 12 million. The countryside is lush green  filled with uncountable numbers of banana trees.\n\nThe Hutu-Tutsi divide may be the country's most notorious characteristic but also its most confounding. The two groups are so closely related that it's nearly impossible for an outsider to tell which the average Rwandan belongs to. Even Rwandans have trouble knowing who is who  especially after two decades of a government push to create a single Rwandan identity.\n\n\n\nFriends: Despite their appalling shared history  Emmanuel and Alice are now friends but say ethnic tensions mean that a second genocide isn't an impossibility\n\nHarrowing: Despite her terrible injuries  Alice lived to tell her tale - unlike the estimated one million others who were butchered by the Interahamwe\n\nTragic: Ophelia Nyiramagumeri (right)  a survivor of the genocide  at a memorial service at the Kicukiro College of Technology football ground - the site of a massacre\n\nAppalling: Venuste  61  from Nyanza Kicukiro saw his daughter murdered in front of him and was forced to play dead to survive\n\nTHE RWANDAN GENOCIDE EXPLAINED\n\nWith an estimated one million people murdered in just 100 days  the 1994 Rwandan genocide is one of the fastest in history. The killings were planned by a cabal of senior government officials known as the akazu and carried out by two government-backed militias - the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi - aided and abetted by Hutu civilians. Part of the ongoing Rwandan Civil War  which began in 1990  the genocidaires targeted members of the minority Tutsi tribe. Also murdered were moderate Hutus  including some politicians  and anyone who opposed the killing. While the reasons for the genocide are complex  a variety of factors including massacres of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers in neighbouring Burundi and the largely Tutsi make-up of the Rwandan Patriotic Front - a rebel group based in neighbouring Uganda - are thought to have contributed. The trigger for the genocide came on the 6th May 1994 when a plane carrying Juvénal Habyarimana  the president of Rwanda  and Cyprien Ntaryamira  the president of Burundi  was shot down as it came into land at Kigali airport. Within hours of their deaths  the first Tutsis were dead and the stage was set for a genocide that continued for 100 days. By the time the Rwandan Patriotic Front  led by current Rwandan president Paul Kagame  took Kigali and effectively ended the genocide  an estimated 70 per cent of Rwanda's Tutsis - 20 per cent of the total population - were dead.\n\nFor Alice  a Tutsi  the genocide began in 1992  when her family took refuge in a church for a week. Hutu community leaders began importing machetes. Houses were burned  cars taken.\n\nHutu leaders created lists of prominent or educated Tutsis targeted for killing. They also held meetings where they told those in attendance how evil the Tutsis were. Like many of his Hutu neighbors  Emmanuel soaked in the message.\n\nThe situation caught fire on April 6  1994  when the plane carrying Rwanda's president was shot down. Hutus started killing Tutsis  who ran for their lives and flooded Alice's village.\n\nThree days later  local Hutu leaders told Emmanuel  then 23  that they had a job for him. They took him to a Tutsi home and ordered him to use his machete.\n\n\n\nA Christian who sang in his church choir  Emmanuel had never killed before. But inside this house he murdered 14 people. The next day  April 12  Emmanuel found a Tutsi doctor in hiding and killed him  too. The day after  he killed two women and a child.\n\n'The very first family I killed  I felt bad  but then I got used to it ' he says. 'Given how we were told that the Tutsis were evil  after the first family I just felt like I was killing our enemies.'\n\nIn the meantime  Alice's family took refuge in a church  just as they had done before  crammed in with hundreds of others. But this time  Hutu attackers threw a bomb inside and set the church on fire.\n\nThose who fled the fire inside died by machetes outside. Alice lost some 26 family members  among the estimated 5 000 victims at the church.\n\nAlice  then 25  escaped with her nine-month-old daughter and a nine-year-old niece into Rwanda's green countryside  moving  hiding  moving. She hid in a forested swamp.\n\n'There were so many bodies all over the place ' she says. 'Hutus would wake up in the morning and go hunting for Tutsis to kill.'\n\nBy late April rebel Tutsi fighters led by Kagame had reached the capital and chased Hutus out. Hutu troops began to flee to neighbouring countries  and the violence spread  with killings carried out by both sides.\n\nOn April 29  Emmanuel joined Hutu soldiers searching the countryside for Tutsis. The attackers blew a whistle whenever they found a Tutsi hiding.\n\nThe murders began at 10am. and lasted until 3pm. Alice had been hiding in a swamp for days  keeping out only the top of her face so she could breathe.\n\n\n\nThat was where the Hutus found her. They surrounded the swamp. Then they attacked. First they killed the girls. When that was done  they came after Alice. She was sure she would die  but instinctively put up her arm up to defend herself.\n\nEmmanuel  Alice's school mate  recognised the woman but couldn't recall her name. Perhaps that made it easier to rain down machete blows on Alice's right arm  severing it just above the wrist. He sliced her face. His colleague pierced a spear through her left shoulder. They left her for dead.\n\nShe was bloodied  scarred  and missing a hand  yes  but not dead. Alice fell unconscious  she says  and was found three days later by other survivors. It was only then that she realised she no longer had a right hand.\n\n\n\nIn the months after the genocide  guilt gnawed away at Emmanuel. He saw his victims during nightmares. In 1996  he turned himself in and confessed.\n\nHis prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003  when Kagame pardoned Hutus who admitted their guilt. After he was freed  he began asking family members of his victims for forgiveness. He joined a group of genocide killers and survivors called Ukurrkuganze  who still meet weekly.\n\n\n\nMemories: With her classmates  Theodette Abayisenga  35  defied the Interahamwe in this Nyange classroom. She lost her leg. Others lost their lives\n\n\n\nNo mercy: Donatille  69  photographed in Nyamata Church  was attacked by gang wielding machetes while in the local marshes and left for dead\n\nFighting back: Damascene  54  on top of the hill in Bisesero  was one of the few Hutus to speak out against the genocide. 48 000 Tutsi were killed on the hill behind him\n\nWidowed: Speciose  62 saw her husband murdered before killers beat her around the head with a hammer. She begged to be killed herself but was left to die slowly.\n\n\n\nIt was there that he saw Alice  the woman he thought he had killed. At first he avoided her. Eventually he kneeled before her and asked for forgiveness. After two weeks of thought and long discussions with her husband  she said yes.\n\n'We had attended workshops and trainings and our hearts were kind of free  and I found it easy to forgive ' she says. 'The Bible says you should forgive and you will also be forgiven.'\n\nJosephine Munyeli is the director of peace and reconciliation programs in Rwanda for World Vision  a U.S.-based aid group. A survivor of the genocide herself  Munyeli says more killers and victims would like to reconcile but many don't know who they attacked or were attacked by.\n\n\n\n'Forgiveness is possible. It's common here ' she says. 'Guilt is heavy. When one realises how heavy it is the first thing they do to recuperate themselves is apologise.'\n\nAlthough Rwanda has made significant progress since the genocide  ethnic tensions remain. Alice worries that some genocide planners were never caught  and that messages denying the genocide still filter into the country from Hutus living abroad. She believes remembrance is important to ensure that another genocide never happens.\n\nFor Emmanuel  the anniversary periods bring back the nightmares. He looks like a man serving penance  who does not want to talk but feels he must.\n\n' I've been asking myself why I acted like a fool  listening to such words  that this person is bad and that person is bad ' Emmanuel says. 'The same people that encouraged the genocide are the ones saying there was no genocide.'\n\nHe  too  worries that the embers of the genocide still smoulder. ' The problem is still there ' Emmanuel says. 'There are Hutus who hate me for telling the truth. There are those up until now who participated in the genocide who deny they took part.'\n\nBrave: Sindayiheba  37  was with his classmates in this Nyange classroom when the genocidaires arrived. He was shot and suffered grenade wounds in the attack\n\nAlone: Juliette  50  almost died trying to protect her baby but although she survived  the rest of her family were killed in this kitchen block\n\n\n\nBereft: Jean Marie Vianney  64  lost his wife and six children. He believes they are buried in one of the mass graves near his home in the Rwandan town of St. Jean\n\nPitiless: Aloys Rwamasirabo stands guard over the ruins of Nyange Church where his entire family died as the church was bulldozed by Interahamwe killers\n\nRefuge: Former Olivier Mugwiza  35  took refuge in the UN-protected Amahoro Stadium in Kigali. Many starved to death while others were killed be killed by shell fire\n\nRemembrance: A young boy listens to survivors of the genocide tell their stories in Rwandan capital Kigali. The talks are part of a programme of memorials Abandoned: Rwandans gather to remember the 2 000 people abandoned to the Interahamwe by the UN at the Kicukiro College of Technology\n\nProcession: Other activities to commemorate the anniversary include a parade following a flame of remembrance - a symbolic fire travelling the country\n\nHorror: The genocide  which lasted for approximately 100 days  came to an end when the Rwandan Patriotic Front  led by Paul Kagame  routed Government forces\n\nShocking: The majority of people killed were members of the Tutsi tribe; an estimated 70 per cent of which was massacred in just 100 days by machete wielding gangs REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF RWANDA'S GENOCIDE: ARCHIVE FEATURING THE FACES OF CHILD SURVIVORS OPENS A moving archive of Polaroid images used to reunite children with their families following the Rwandan genocide has been re-opened to mark the 20th anniversary of the start of a genocide that saw an estimated one million people lose their lives.\n\nThe photographs  taken by Save the Children in the months following the war in 1994  were carried from village to village to try to find the families of an estimated 8 000 children following the brutal 100-day conflict  which destroyed the country’s infrastructure and left it with the highest proportion of orphans in the world.\n\nOne of the children to feature in the polaroids is Gloriose  now a university student  who was only five years old when her parents were killed in the genocide.\n\n'When this photo was taken I still believed that everything was going to be okay and that my parents were still alive and that they would provide me with a happy life ' she remembers.\n\n'I would call upon the international community and other humanitarian organisations to help other children who are now going through a situation like I went through. They are victims of situations that are beyond their control.'\n\nSpeaking about the archive  Geoffrey Mugisha  Country Director for Save the Children in Rwanda  said: 'The size of this archive reminds us of the almost unimaginable scale of the terror in Rwanda 20 years ago.\n\n'And yet the individual pictures provide us with a window through which we can see stories of triumph and survival. We look at these children  frozen in time  and know that children in the world still suffer like this today.\n\n'The greatest way we can show respect to the victims and survivors of the Rwandan genocide is to do our utmost to ensure that no child ever again has to endure what these children did 20 years ago.'

It and many others are displayed at the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre Heartbreaking: Photos of some of the people who died in the 1994 massacre hang in the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre in the

One confirmed dead in another explosion on passenger bus,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/one-confirmed-dead-in-another-explosion-on-passenger-bus-3595752,"['Police said Monday that one person had been confirmed dead and several others injured in an explosion reported on a bus in Mpigi District in central Uganda.\n\nBy the time of filing this story  a team of bomb experts had been dispatched to Lungala  along the Kampala-Masaka highway  where the deadly explosion occurred on the bus belonging to Swift Safaris Bus company under registration number UAU 989T  at around 5pm.\n\n“The bus was traveling from Kampala to Bushenyi. So far one person has been confirmed dead and several other victims including injured persons being evacuated from the scene. The explosion comes three days after the bomb attack in Komamboga. The scene has been cordoned off pending a thorough assessment and investigation by the bomb experts. We shall periodically give updates surrounding the incident ” police spokesperson  CP Fred Enanga said in a Monday statement.\n\nPhotos and videos shared on social media showed a man\'s head leaning against a shuttered window  with reports indicating that he was one of the victims of the explosion.\n\nThe bus explosion happened just hours after the Islamic State (IS) group on Monday claimed responsibility for a deadly weekend bombing at a pork joint in Komamboga  a northern suburb of the capital  Kampala that police called an \'act of domestic terrorism.\'\n\nInvestigators said a 20-year-old woman was killed and three others injured in a blast at a popular roadside eatery in northern Kampala on Saturday evening.\n\nPolice said the crude bomb left underneath a table indicated the work of an unsophisticated local outfit  and played down any connection to foreign networks.\n\nHowever in a message sent via its communication channels  the Islamic State\'s Central Africa Province said it carried out the attack  and claimed it killed two people and injured five.\n\nThe acting greater Bushenyi regional police commander  Mr Adrian Kwetegyereza is one of the people who were injured in the bus explosion in Mpigi District\n\n""A security detachment from the soldiers of the Caliphate was able to detonate an explosive device inside a tavern in which elements and spies for the Crusader Ugandan army were gathered "" read part of the statement quoted by the SITE Intelligence Group  which monitors militant communications.\n\nOn October 8  IS claimed its first attack in Uganda  alleging a unit from the same Central Africa operation bombed a police post in Kampala that resulted in injuries.\n\nNo explosion or any injuries were reported by authorities or local media at the time  though police later confirmed a minor incident had occurred without providing further details.\n\nHowever  in the following days  both Britain and France updated their travel advice  saying terrorists were ""very likely to try and carry out attacks in Uganda"" and urging vigilance in crowded areas.\n\nIn 2010  twin bombings in Kampala targeting fans watching the World Cup final left 76 people dead.\n\nSomalia\'s Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility for the blasts at a restaurant and at a rugby club.\n\nThe attack  the first outside Somalia by Al-Shabaab  was seen as revenge for Uganda sending troops to the war-torn country as part of an African Union mission to confront the insurgents.\n\nPresident Yoweri Museveni on Sunday vowed that those responsible for the latest attack would be caught and expressed condolences to those killed and injured.']",police say monday one person confirm dead several others injure explosion report bus mpigi district central

One of the deceased died from their injuries after being transported to hospital  while efforts to recover the bodies of five others were hampered by the unsafe site and poor weather conditions.\n\nImage: Ottawa Police\n\nThe incident happened at a facility belonging to Eastway Tank Pump and Meter Ltd. – a manufacturer and repairer of tanker trucks. Ottawa Police said that emergency services were called to the scene at around 13:30 local time where Ottawa Fire Services tackled a significant fire.\n\n\n\nThree people were found at the scene and transported to hospital. One of the injured died of their wounds  one was kept at hospital in a serious but stable condition  and the third person was released later on the same day.\n\n\n\nAfter the fire had been extinguished  Ottawa Police said that five people were still unaccounted for. All five had been inside the facility at the time of the blast and it was therefore unlikely that the four men and one woman would be found alive.\n\n\n\nIn a statement  Eastway Tank’s President Neil Greene said: “It is with great sadness that we learned that one of our colleagues perished as a result of the tragic explosion  with five remaining missing and one in hospital. My heart goes out to their families  loved ones and to all of our employees who are reeling from this deep loss. We remain in close contact with investigators  and we will cooperate with authorities on all ensuing investigations. We want to get to the bottom of what happened.”\n\n\n\nFour of the missing people were confirmed as deceased on January 16 when four bodies were located. However  due to poor weather conditions and the unsafe nature of the site  it was not possible for the bodies to be recovered and identified. Ottawa Police said the continued risk of periodic flare-ups  presence of asbestos  chemicals and structural collapse had slowed recovery efforts. Rescue efforts and the clean-up of the site was expected to continue well into the week beginning January 17.\n\n\n\nThe cause of the initial explosion has yet to be determined.

The area  in the Beyoglu district of Turkey’s largest city  had been crowded as usual at the weekend with shoppers  tourists and families.\n\nSpeaking before his departure to the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Indonesia on Sunday  Erdogan said the explosion was a “treacherous attack” and pledged that its perpetrators would be punished.\n\n“Our people can rest assured that the culprits behind the attack will be punished as they deserve ” he said at a press conference  adding that initial information suggested “a woman played a part” in it.\n\n“It would be wrong to say this is undoubtedly a terrorist attack  but the initial developments and initial intelligence from my governor is that it smells like terrorism ” Erdogan said.\n\nFour people died at the scene and two died in the hospital  Erdogan said.\n\nThe explosion occurred at about 4:20pm (13:20 GMT) on Sunday  according to officials.\n\nA video posted online showed flames erupting and a loud bang  as pedestrians turned and ran away.\n\n“My condolences to those who lost their lives in the explosion on Istiklal avenue ” Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility. Turkey was hit by a string of deadly bombings between 2015 and 2017 by ISIL (ISIS) and by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).\n\nAl Jazeera has obtained pictures of the woman suspected to be behind the bombing  who officials believe was a member of the PKK.\n\n#الجزيرة تحصل على صور من زوايا مختلفة للسيدة المشتبه في أنها تقف وراء هجوم #اسطنبول pic.twitter.com/DgdojrKMMY — قناة الجزيرة (@AJArabic) November 13  2022\n\nTurkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag told A Haber television that the woman was observed sitting on one of the benches on the street for more than 40 minutes.\n\nThe explosion occurred just minutes after she got up  he said.\n\n“There are two possibilities ” he said. “There’s either a mechanism placed in this bag and it explodes  or someone remotely explodes [it]”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu  reporting from Istiklal avenue  said officials also believe two others were involved.\n\n“I learned from my sources that the other two suspects are two very young men who were born after 2000 ” she said.\n\nKoseoglu added there was no information on the identities of the perpetrators yet.\n\nKoseoglu said the explosion comes as a shock because there have not been any recent warnings over attacks in the city.\n\n“But security measures have remained high in the area ” she said.\n\nFootage from the aftermath of the attack showed people attending to victims. Later  investigators in white outfits were seen collecting material from the scene.\n\n“When I heard the explosion  I was petrified  people froze  looking at each other.

He said the rest remain in critical condition in Adjumani hospital.\n\n“Some children in Maji II Refugee Settlement went to play beside the hillside and they found an explosive  started playing with it  and cut it with a panga and it exploded. The explosion killed six children on the spot and injured another eleven. The eleven injured children were taken to hospital but unfortunately  two of them died from the injuries they sustained. Many of those admitted in the hospital are still in critical condition ” he said.\n\nManyok said the children were aged between 5 and 11 years. He added he could not tell what type of explosive it was or if it was old or new because he did not see it.\n\nSuperintendent of Police  Angucia Josephine  the Uganda Police’s West Nile/North West Nile Regional police spokesperson  confirmed to Radio Tamazuj on Friday that indeed several children were killed and injured by what the police suspected to be an old explosive left by rebels.\n\n“Six children were indeed killed and five injured in an explosion on 16 February at Maaji II Refugee Settlement in Adjumani district ” SP Angucia said. “The children went out playing and when they came across this suspicious-looking metal they decided to pick it and cut it using a panga and that is when the item exploded hence killing three instantly and injuring several of them  three of whom died later in the hospital. The total of those dead is six and five injured.\n\nRecently in the same district  about a month ago  there was another explosion that injured two people from both the refugee and host community.\n\nAccording to SP Angucia  police took the fragments for analysis  “but our analysis as police is that since Adjumani district was invaded by the former Lord’s Resistance Army rebels of Joseph Kony and the Uganda National Liberation Front rebels in the past  it is suspected that they could have left some grenades and other explosives hidden in the bushes as they were expelled from the area.”\n\nShe said that the unexploded ordinance gets exposed through bush burning during the dry spell which could have exposed the children to these dangers.\n\n“It is an old bomb  when you look at the fragments  it is really old. Which means they must have been abandoned by the said group of rebels in the 1980s and early 90s ” Angucia added.\n\nShe pointed out sensitization is ongoing and police have teamed up with other stakeholders to educate the communities and to guard against similar incidents.\n\nThe Uganda Police identified the deceased as; Joseph Otto  6  Drago James  9  Duku Emmanuel  7  Amaruma Isaac  11  Edema Thomas  10  Mandre Justine  14.\n\nThe five who sustained injuries include; Wani Jonathan  10  Abao James  7  Andruga Dominic  14  Bazio Joyce  12  and one who is yet to be identified.""]",adjumani uganda feb n nsix south sudanese child kill eleven others injure play explosive device maji ii refugee settlement uganda adjumani district n naccording wilson manyok chairperson south sudanese refugee northern uganda wednesday explosion kill six child spot two others succumb injury hospital say rest remain critical condition adjumani hospital n nsome child maji ii refugee settlement go play beside hillside find explosive start play cut panga explode explosion kill six child spot injure another eleven eleven injured child take hospital unfortunately two die injury sustain many admitted hospital still critical condition say n nmanyok say child age year add could tell type explosive old new see n nsuperintendent police angucia josephine uganda police west nile north west nile regional police spokesperson confirm radio tamazuj friday indeed several child kill injured police suspect old explosive left rebel n nsix child indeed kill five injured explosion february maaji ii refugee settlement adjumani district sp angucia say child go play come across suspicious look metal decide pick cut use panga item explode hence kill three instantly injure several three die later hospital total dead six five injured n nrecently district month ago another explosion injure two people refugee host community n naccording sp angucia police take fragment analysis analysis police since adjumani district invade former lord resistance army rebel joseph kony uganda national liberation front rebel past suspect could leave grenades explosive hidden bush expel area n nshe say unexploded ordinance get expose bush burn dry spell could expose child danger n nit old bomb look fragment really old mean must abandon say group rebel early angucia add n nshe point sensitization ongoing police team stakeholder educate community guard similar incident n nthe uganda police identify deceased joseph otto drago james duku emmanuel amaruma isaac edema thomas mandre justine n nthe five sustained injury include wani jonathan abao james andruga dominic bazio joyce one yet identify,0.8421249260915412,1

"Norton meth lab explosion kills 38-year-old man, prompts evacuations",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/22/metro/norton-meth-lab-explosion-kills-man/,"['Back at the apartment on Faith Way  investigators traced the 12:53 a.m. explosion to an apparent methamphetamine lab there and evacuated the six-unit building where most residents  including the man’s mother  are at least 55 years old.\n\nA 38-year-old man emerged from the wreckage  his face reddened by the explosion  saw his mother  a neighbor said  and fled in her car to a friend’s house in Attleboro. Rescuers found him there and took him to the hospital  where he was pronounced dead.\n\nNORTON -- The blast exploded in a first-floor bathroom just before 1 a.m. Saturday with a force that knocked down the door and blew out windows of the apartment bordering a forest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Her son is dead. That is the most horrifying thing ” said Jeannie Steele  78  who lives in the same building and was friendly with the victim. “The last time you see your son  his face is all burnt and he is running from life into death.”\n\nGet Metro Headlines The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAuthorities on Saturday didn’t release the name of the victim. Steele and an official briefed on the investigation said the man began living with his mother at the residence less than a year ago after spending time in prison for meth-related offenses.\n\nThe illegal stimulant  which caused an abuse epidemic in the West and Midwest  has recently taken root in Massachusetts  the Globe reported in August  creating worries among public health officials who are already struggling with the opioid crisis.\n\nIn one high-profile case  State Police last month raided a North Attleborough home and arrested two people who lived there after finding evidence that the property concealed a secret meth lab.\n\nIn the Norton case  members of the state’s Clandestine Lab Enforcement Team were dispatched Saturday to investigate and clean up chemicals and residue released during the explosion. No one else was injured in the blast  authorities said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“One of the great concerns about someone making meth in a residential situation is the risk to everybody else ” said Jennifer Mieth  spokeswoman for the state Department of Fire Services  which oversees the enforcement team. “They really put other people in the building at risk.”\n\nResidents were evacuated to a nearby community center until a little after 9 a.m. when authorities let them return to their homes.\n\n“It was unnerving to think something like that goes on ” said Anne Rhodes  who was evacuated from her apartment. “I was very grateful that it wasn’t a bigger deal. It could have been the whole place.”\n\nSteele said she spoke to the victim on Friday. He bought her milk and delivered a heavy package of canned pea soup to her door.\n\nShe woke up early Saturday after a neighbor called saying she heard an explosion and worried whether Steele was OK. A short time later  officers came into her apartment and told her she needed to evacuate because of an explosion  Steele said.\n\nWhen officers learned the man had fled the apartment  police notified neighboring communities  checked with area hospitals  and issued an alert for the vehicle he was driving.\n\nA short time later  police and firefighters in Attleboro fielded a 911 call about a man experiencing “medical issues” at a residence on Pike Avenue  less than 4 miles from the blast site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestigators determined the stricken man had fled the explosion in Norton and rushed him to Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro  where he was pronounced dead  police said.\n\nSteele said the victim had told her he wanted to get a job and discussed his background with her.\n\n“When you’re incarcerated for a length of time it’s not that easy to come out and be among the populace because you’re accustomed to being institutionalized ” she said.\n\nIn 2016  the victim pleaded guilty in Barnstable Superior Court to charges of methamphetamine possession with intent to distribute and was sentenced to four to six years in prison  court records show.\n\nNo one answered the door Saturday at his apartment  which was decorated with artificial flowers and a sign welcoming friends. Outside  part of the building was boarded up  cracked windows sat on the grass  and a brown shutter dangled from the siding.\n\nSteele  who is being treated for cancer  reflected on the man’s flight from the apartment following the blast  imagining that he was afraid and feeling excruciating pain.\n\n“I put myself in his shoes of what I would feel under such circumstances "" she said. “That in itself is frightening.”\n\nLaura Crimaldi can be reached at laura.crimaldi@globe.com.

Officials said the cause of the explosion was still under investigation but that an initial assessment suggested it was caused by firedamp  referring to concentrations of flammable gas like methane.\n\n© Erdem Sahin/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock A man walks past a coal mine in the aftermath of an explosion in Bartin  Turkey  on Saturday.\n\nAs fire burned in the mine early Saturday  rescuers hoped to reach about 15 workers believed to be alive but trapped roughly 1 000 feet underground  Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said. As the day wore on  officials announced higher death tolls  dashing hopes of a rescue. Finally  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  during a visit to the area late Saturday  said the last miner who was unaccounted for had died.\n\n“It is very important to understand how this explosion took place ” Erdogan said  adding that investigations into the cause were underway.\n\n© Erdem Sahin/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Relatives attend the funeral ceremony of mine explosion victim Ridvan Acet at the Kazpinari village after an explosion occurred at a coal mine in Bartin  Turkey  on Saturday.\n\nAt least 110 people were working inside the mine when the explosion occurred. Eleven workers were being treated for injuries in Istanbul and in Bartin province  Soylu said. Fifty-eight workers were rescued or escaped the mine  he added.\n\nPhotographs showed throngs of people gathered at the entrance of the mine  including tearful relatives and rescue workers  a waiting row of ambulances and an injured miner covered in what appeared to be black soot.\n\nTurkey suffered its worst mining accident in 2014  when 301 people were killed after an explosion in a coal mine in the town of Soma  about 150 miles south of Istanbul  sparked a fire that burned for days. Protests after the accident targeted the mine’s owners as well as Erdogan  after he downplayed the incident  suggesting that such accidents were commonplace.\n\nGovernment officials appeared eager to strike a different tone after the latest accident. Erdogan  who canceled a trip to southeastern Turkey and traveled to Bartin on Saturday  said on Twitter that the rescue work had started “immediately” after the accident and that the “families and children of our lost miner friends are in our caring hands.”\n\n“We will not allow the slightest grievance ” he said. “Our judicial authorities will investigate this tragic incident thoroughly and even the slightest negligence will not be left unanswered.” Speaking at the scene of the accident  he added: “We are the people who believe in the plan of destiny.”\n\nErdogan also spoke with an unidentified woman who said her brother was among the dead miners  according to video of the conversation carried by local news outlets.\n\n“My brother said there was a gas leak here 10 to 15 days ago  they will detonate this place ” the woman  crying  told Erdogan. “How was it neglected? He said they’re going to blow us up here.”\n\n“He felt it was going to happen ” the woman added.\n\nFahim reported from Doha  Qatar.

Top Tory confronted over own governments Rwanda warnings in car crash ...,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-minister-skewered-over-governments-26718621,"['Home Office minister Tom Pursglove complained there were \'appalling stereotypes\' about Rwanda - so Sky News immediately read out his own government\'s travel advice\n\nTory minister confronted over his OWN government\'s Rwanda warnings in car crash interview\n\nA Tory behind Rwanda flights was confronted with his own government’s warnings about the country in a car crash interview.\n\nTom Pursglove complained there had been “appalling stereotypes thrown around” about the east African country  after Boris Johnson announced Britain’s unwanted asylum seekers will be flown there by force.\n\nBut the Home Office minister was hauled up on his claim by a Sky News presenter - who read out Foreign Office advice.\n\nThe advice said: “Homosexuality is not illegal in Rwanda but remains frowned on by many.\n\n“LGBT individuals can experience discrimination and abuse  including from local authorities. There are no specific anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT individuals.""\n\nTV host Niall Paterson blasted: “That is the advice given to gay people in this country from the Foreign Office - just round the corner from you!”\n\nIt’s understood LGBT+ people  women and refugees from Rwanda itself could be sent to Rwanda under Boris Johnson’s policy.\n\nMore than 200 people from Rwanda itself have applied for UK asylum in the past decade  Home Office figures show.\n\nAnd across the EU  255 Rwandans had an asylum claim granted in 2020 alone - putting the country in the top 20.\n\nIn a later interview Mr Pursglove also was unable to name Rwanda’s population or life expectancy  saying: “I’m afraid I’ve not got that figure to hand this morning.” He also could not say how much it will cost per person after a £120m “initial” fund.\n\nStanding outside the Home Office  Mr Pursglove insisted “Rwanda have made enormous strides forward”.\n\nDespite the 1994 genocide that slaughtered 800 000 people in 100 days  he said: “They have a rich and proud history  rather like we do in this country  of providing sanctuary to people who need it.”\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nHe added: “Rwanda… has a female majority parliament  it has an anti-discrimination law that runs right through its constitution.\n\n“The UNHCR themselves place refugees in Rwanda as part of their schemes which of course is providing sanctuary to them.”\n\nYet it has emerged Boris Johnson’s government condemned Rwanda’s human rights record less than a year ago.\n\nThe UK International Ambassador for Human Rights  Rita French  said in a speech uploaded to the government’s own website: “We regret that Rwanda did not support our recommendation… to conduct transparent  credible and independent investigations into allegations of human rights violations including deaths in custody and torture.”\n\nShe said the UK welcomed Rwanda’s “progress” and “engagement” but issued a warning about people in “transit centres”.\n\nAsylum seekers removed from Britain to Rwanda will be put in hostels for up to three months.\n\nImage: Daily Mirror) Daily Mirror)\n\n“We were disappointed that Rwanda did not support the UK recommendation to screen  identify and provide support to trafficking victims  including those held in Government transit centres ” she said.\n\nAn ex-Cabinet minister today warned the Tory plans to send Channel boat migrants to Rwanda will provoke violent confrontations at airports as they prepare to board military flights.\n\nFormer International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell feared asylum seekers would forcibly resist attempts to corral them onto planes from Britain to east Africa.\n\n“It will be very difficult to transport them because we know that people will fight to stop getting on planes ” he told the BBC.\n\n“It’s extremely difficult to get people who are desperate and who do not want to get on a flight onto a flight.”\n\nHe said RAF aircraft would be needed - piling pressure on the stretched air force.\n\n“You won’t be able to use civilian flights  you’ll have to use military aircraft - our military aircraft are needed for other matters.” He also said costs would be “astronomical” and “eye-watering”.\n\nUnder a five-year deal starting yesterday  anyone the Home Office deems “inadmissible” to claim asylum in the UK can now be forcibly removed to Rwanda. They will have no option to apply for asylum in Britain.\n\nPeople who passed through a “safe” country can be deemed inadmissible under new rules the Tories pushed through post-Brexit.\n\nNo10 policy chief Andrew Griffith last night said he hoped flights will be operational in ""weeks  or a small number of months"".\n\nBut Boris Johnson admitted the scheme could be held up by legal challenges.\n\nAn expert raised fears whole families could try to cross the Channel to thwart Boris Johnson’s bid to target single men under 40.\n\nCharlie Yaxley  a former Mediterranean crisis spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  told the Mirror: “Whenever you close one door  refugees will open a window somewhere else.\n\n“After the war in Libya you still had families putting their babies and whole family on board boats in the Mediterranean.

Jerusalem: One dead after explosions at bus station and Ramot junction ...,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/middleeast/explosion-jerusalem-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html,"[""Jerusalem CNN —\n\nTwo explosions shook Jerusalem early Wednesday  killing a teenager and injuring 18 others in a suspected “combined terror attack ” authorities said.\n\nThe first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance to Jerusalem at 7:06 a.m.  injuring 12 people  including the teen who later died  according to Magen David Adom (MDA)  Israel’s Red Cross affiliate. Three of the wounded were in serious condition.\n\nA second explosion was reported almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction  at 7:30 a.m.  police said. Three people were evacuated with minor injuries  while four were treated for “stress symptoms” according to MDA. Two Americans were among those injured  US Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides said on Twitter.\n\nInitial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects  the police spokesperson said.\n\nAn Israeli Police spokesperson said the devices used in Wednesday’s attacks were very powerful and most likely detonated remotely by a “well-organized cell.” One device was hidden behind a wall and the other behind a bush  the spokesperson added.\n\n“The terrorists knew the area well ” the spokesperson said.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the incident.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was “different from what we have seen in recent years.”\n\n“An extensive intelligence effort is now underway that will lead us to find these heinous terrorists  those behind them  and those who provided them with weapons ” Lapid said. “We will find them. They can run  they can hide — it won’t help them; the security forces will reach them. If they resist  they will be eliminated. If not  we will punish them to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nThe individual killed was a 15-year-old named Aryeh Shechopek  authorities said. Shechopek was a student at a yeshiva  a Jewish religious school  and lived in the Har Nof neighborhood in Jerusalem  the family said. Shechopek also held Canadian citizenship  Israeli and Canadian authorities said. Israeli emergency services had earlier reported that Shechopek was 16 years old.\n\nA bus was damaged in the blast Wednesday. Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe site of an explosion is pictured near a bus station at the Givat Sha'ul Junction  near the exit from the city of Jerusalem. United Hatzalah\n\nLapid offered his condolences for the family  calling Shechopek “a boy who never wronged anyone in the world.”\n\n“He was murdered simply because he was Jewish ” he said.\n\nThe attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015. At least 146 Palestinian civilians and militants have been killed there in 2022  according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n\nAt the site of the first blast  images showed debris strewn on the ground and a parked bus with holes pierced in its windscreen. Metal railings surrounding the bus stop were also damaged and the area was cordoned off.\n\nTwo paramedics from MDA said when they arrived at the bus station they found two seriously injured people lying on the ground.\n\n“We were at the MDA station by the entrance to the city when we heard a large explosion ” they said. “We immediately headed to the scene in large numbers  including ambulances  MICUs (mobile intensive care units) and medicycles.”\n\n“Two seriously wounded were lying nearby  a 16-year-old in the bus stop and a 45-year-old on the sidewalk.”\n\nSenior MDA paramedic Emanuel Stern said it was a “miracle” that more people weren’t hurt.\n\n“If the bus would have been full of passengers  or if there were people waiting at the bus stop  this whole incident could have ended very badly ” Stern said.\n\nRaphael Poch  a spokesman for United Hatzalah International  a volunteer medic group  told CNN first responders saw a variety of injuries  including some from the blast itself.

"Rwanda: Political opposition persists amid death, disappearance and ...",https://towardfreedom.org/story/rwanda-political-opposition-persists-amid-death-disappearance-and-detention/,['On February 17  the world woke up to the disturbing news of the death of Kizito Mihigo  38  a Rwandan gospel music artist and arguably the country’s most visible cultural figure. Mihigo was found dead in a prison cell in Kigali  the country’s capital  after being detained for three days.\n\nMihigo’s problems with the Rwandan government began following the uploading of a new song titled Igisobanuro Cy’urupfu (The Meaning of Death) to YouTube.\n\nThe Meaning of Death called out the official line of the government: that the Tutsi community alone suffered the April 1994 genocide  while Hutu people are made to appear as the sole perpetrators of the fratricide.\n\nBut Mihigo  who was a Tutsi  said members of both communities suffered in the genocide and should be accorded recognition. His version clearly contradicts the official version  promoted during the 26-year old regime of President Paul Kagame  62.\n\nMihigo was first arrested after the song was released in April 2014  but police said the song had nothing to do with his incarceration. They claimed he was a suspect in serious crimes  including a plot to assassinate Kagame.\n\nIn February 2015  Mihigo was sentenced to 10 years in prison  but was released on a presidential pardon in September 2018. The Rwanda Broadcasting Agency has since banned the airing of his songs both on TV and radio.\n\nTutsi communities make up 14 percent of Rwanda’s population  while Hutu communities make up 85 percent of the country’s 12.6 million inhabitants. The Twa people make up the remaining one percent.\n\nIn the wake of the genocide  Kagame became Vice President and Minister of Defense. In 2000  after then President Pasteur Bizimungu abruptly resigned  Kagame went from de facto leader to president. In 2015  Rwanda’s parliament voted to change term limit laws specifically for Kagame. These laws now allow him to stay in power until 2034.\n\nIn the 2017 presidential elections  Kagame claimed to have received 98 per cent of the vote at the polls. But that figure is suspect at best. The US  United Nations  Human Rights Watch  and others condemned the election process as being fraudulent  suppressing free speech and silencing political opponents.\n\nThose elections marked a turning point for Kagame. The previously slow slide into authoritarianism took a sharp turn for the worse. Kagame quickly ordered the closure of some 700 churches  alleging they had broken the country’s building code and had failed to comply with health  safety and noise regulations. The killing of activists and opposition figures also increased.\n\nMihigo has become the latest victim in a list of extensively documented but not independently investigated deaths in a country where individuals thought to have either fallen out with the President or shown open opposition to his rule are likely to become victims.\n\nRwanda’s opposition  which is made up of 11 registered parties with little chance of governing  have called for an impartial inquiry after refusing to accept the official explanation that Mihigo’s death was suicide by hanging  as the state alleges.\n\nTo date  the Rwandan government  led by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) under Kagame  has refused to investigate Mihigo’s killing  as well as other murders and disappearances of dissidents.\n\nCompounding the human rights situation in Rwanda is a March 22 order that made this country the first in sub-Saharan Africa to order a total shutdown after confirming 17 cases of the COVID-19 virus. As this story went to press  there were 105 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Rwanda.\n\nMihigo  a rising star after the horror of genocide\n\nThe genocide deeply marked Mihigo’s life  as it did the lives of millions of Rwandans. From April 7  1994 until July 15 of the same year  Rwanda experienced 100 days of genocide  during which upwards of 800 000 people  mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus  were murdered by Hutu extremists.\n\nOne of the hundreds of thousands of victims was Mihigo’s father  himself a Tutsi. Mihigo  then age 12  sought temporary safety from the fratricide in the neighboring state of Burundi.\n\nMihigo reunited with surviving members of his family once the RPF took power in 1994.\n\nAn early plan to join the army and take vengeance for the death of his father did not work out for Mihigo  as he was turned away from enrolling. At 14  he began to study at the local Karubanda Minor Seminary  where his talent as a musician quickly became evident. President Kagame later awarded Mihigo a scholarship to study at the prestigious Conservatoire de Paris  in France.\n\nThough he began his career as a performer in France  Mihigo was nostalgic for his home country and returned to Rwanda in 2011. He soon gained national recognition and notoriety  and was tapped to perform in government functions around the country.\n\nKizito was awarded a prize by the first lady  Jeannette Kagame  for establishing a foundation to promote peace and reconciliation in his deeply scarred nation. Later  the government partially bankrolled the Kizito Mihigo Peace Foundation  which saw him travel the country as a peace ambassador.\n\nRene Claude Mugenzi  43  runs Britain’s Global Campaign for Rwandans’ Human Rights. Mugenzi says the culpability of Rwanda’s government in the murder of Mihigo is undeniable.\n\n“There is no doubt that Mihigo was murdered by the security apparatus that coalesces around Kagame. And the reason he was killed is because he had become very popular within the country and particularly within the youth demography ” Mugenzi told Toward Freedom. “He had begun singing about a part of the Rwandan history that Kagame is opposed to  most notably that not only Tutsis have been killed  also other ethnic groups were killed and should be remembered too.”\n\nMugenzi says he fled his native nation due to the violence  settling in the UK in 1997. In May 2011  official British reports indicated that Scotland Yard informed Mugenzi  then aged 35  of a plot by the Rwandan Government to assassinate him. He was put under protection and the UK Government warned its Rwandan counterparts against attempting to assassinate its citizens on its soil. Rwandan officials denied the allegations.\n\nIn a complicated turn of events  Mugenzi’s father Joseph fled to the Netherlands as a political refugee after he was convicted in absentia by a court in Kigali of perpetrating the genocide of 1994. He remains wanted back home by the RPF government. The younger Mugenzi says his father is innocent of the charges leveled against him  and accuses the RPF regime of overseeing a biased and servile judicial system.\n\n“What the world forgets also is that Rwanda has political refugees in at least six neighboring states  which is a telling testimony of the brutality associated with Kagame ” he said. Unfortunately  the persecution of Rene Claude Mugenzi  even in exile  is far from unique.\n\nKagame’s persecution of the opposition\n\nLast October  an investigation by the Financial Times revealed Israeli software developed by the NSO Group  was being used to spy on Rwandese political dissidents and critics living abroad. The spyware targeted individuals through WhatsApp calls and allowed hackers to access personal data on the phone  such as messages and location.\n\nIn September 2019  South Africa’s National Prosecution Authority issued arrest warrants for two Rwandans accused of murdering Colonel Patrick Karegeya  who was found dead in his hotel room in Johannesburg on January 1  2014.\n\nKaregeya had been the head of Rwanda’s external intelligence services beginning in 1994 to 2004. He later fell out with the Kagame regime and was imprisoned twice before fleeing to South Africa in 2007.\n\nLess than a year later  Rwanda’s former army chief of staff General Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in South Africa. Nyamwasa had fled Rwanda and been granted political asylum three months before the shooting.\n\nAccording to media reports  South Africa’s special investigative unit said in written testimony that Karegeya’s murder and the attack on Nyamwasa “were directly linked to the involvement of the Rwandan government.” Both Karegeya and Nyamwasa were outspoken critics of the Rwandan government and President Kagame.\n\nIn the days following Karegeya’s murder  Rwandan officials gloated about his death. “It’s not about how u start  it’s how u finish. This man was a self-declared enemy of my Gov& my country  U expect pity?” tweeted then Minister of Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo. “When you choose to be a dog  you die like a dog ” said Defence Minister James Kabarebe after Karegeya’s death.\n\nKagame himself came close to condoning Karegeya’s murder in a public speech  saying: “Any person still alive who may be plotting against Rwanda  whoever they are  will pay the price…Whoever it is; it is a matter of time.”\n\nMihigo’s death is the latest in a spate of killings and disappearances has haunted the opposition over the past year.\n\nThe UDF party was formed in exile and is Rwanda’s most vocal opposition alliance  formerly headed by Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza  who ran for the country’s top seat in 2010.\n\nInstead of becoming president  Umuhoza was jailed on 30 October 2012. She was sentenced to eight years imprisonment by the High Court of Kigali for conspiracy against the country through terrorism and war and genocide denial.\n\nIn December of 2013  Rwanda’s Supreme Court upheld Umuhoza’s conviction and increased her jail term from eight to 15 years. In September 2018 she was unexpectedly released from prison following a presidential pardon (she was pardoned at the same time as Mihigo). But the attacks on her party didn’t stop with her release.\n\nIn October 2018  the UDF’s deputy leader  Boniface Twagirimana  vanished from a high security prison where he had been held on suspicion of trying to overthrow the government and has not been seen since. He has never reappeared.\n\nThen  in July of last year  Eugène Ndereyimana  another member of UDF  was reported missing by his colleagues. He remains disappeared. A few months later  Syridio Dusabumuremyi  who served as national coordinator  of the UDF was found dead in his shop. Colleagues said he had been stabbed several times and his throat cut.\n\nThe Government of Rwanda has refused to explain who or what could be behind these suspicious deaths and disappearances. In the course of this investigation  I contacted Johnstone Busingye  Rwanda’s Minister of Justice  who failed to respond to multiple requests for comment. Providence Umurungi  the head of International Justice and Judicial Cooperation failed to call back with a statement  after promising to do so in a telephone conversation.\n\nIn an email to Toward Freedom  Umuhoza said that the human rights situation in Rwanda is frustrating because “nobody has been brought before the court. Within one year I lost four colleagues. Murdered or missing.”\n\n“I am in regular contact with the Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) who routinely remind me that even in developed countries there are assassinations that have never been resolved. This is why I believe the only way to navigate this situation is by calling upon independent investigators to get engaged ” she wrote.\n\nIn a widely shared France 24 interview  Kagame dismissed the European Union’s 2018 report of “serious civil and political rights violations” in Rwanda as “ridiculous” and brushed aside questions about critics being killed  attacked  jailed  silenced  or forced into exile in the lead up to the 2017 presidential polls.\n\nBut the voices against the official version are mounting as attacks on critics continue. “These cases of suspicious disappearances follow a similar pattern that targets opposition figures and people seen to have… dissented with President Kagame ” said Lewis Mudge  the Central Africa Director at Human Rights Watch (HRW). “The sad fact is that no independent inquiries are carried out or allowed in the country.”\n\n“On the international stage  Rwanda is a model of law and order  yet we are seeing a spate of violent and brazen attacks against opposition members go unpunished ” said Mudge in a telephone interview. “The contrast is jarring.”\n\nToday  Mihigo’s songs no longer receive airplay in Rwanda  leaving little doubt that what he stood for ruffled feathers among the political elite in Kigali. And with the government unwilling to allow an independent inquiry into the beloved songwriter’s mysterious death  there is a lingering perception that the government is the one responsible.\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nCharles Wachira is a foreign correspondent based in Nairobi  Kenya formerly an East Africa correspondent with Bloomberg LP.

Rwandas ex-spy chief found dead in a South Africa hotel - CTVNews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/rwanda-s-ex-spy-chief-found-dead-in-a-south-africa-hotel-1.1614772,"['JOHANNESBURG  South Africa -- The body of Rwanda\'s former spy chief was found  possibly strangled  in a hotel in South Africa  police said Thursday. Rwandan dissidents accused President Paul Kagame of ordering his assassination.\n\nThe suspicious death of Patrick Karegeya  a former Kagame ally who turned against him  follows a pattern of assassinations ordered by the Rwandan president  said Theogene Rudasingwa of the opposition coalition Rwandan National Congress. Kagame\'s government vehemently denies it has targeted dissidents.\n\nKaregeya\'s body was discovered in a room at Johannesburg\'s plush Michelangelo Towers hotel on New Year\'s Day  and many questions remain unanswered in a country with a high crime rate.\n\n""He was found in the hotel room dead on the bed "" said a statement from South African police spokeswoman Lt. Col. Katlego Mogale. ""A towel with blood and a rope were found in the hotel room safe. There is a possibility that he might have been strangled."" She said a murder investigation has been opened in the death of the 53-year-old who reportedly fled to South Africa in 2007.\n\nRwandan High Commissioner Vincent Karega told local broadcaster eNCA that talk of assassination is an ""emotional reaction and opportunistic way of playing politics."" He urged people to wait for a report from the South African police.\n\nGunmen twice tried to kill Kagame\'s former chief of army staff  Lt. Gen. Kayumba Nyamwasa  while he was living in exile in Johannesburg in 2010. Nyamwasa told The Associated Press in 2012 that Kagame has hunted him and other dissidents around the world  ""using hired killer squads.""\n\nKaregeya  the former Rwandan intelligence boss  said in a conversation on Nov. 30 with an AP journalist that he understood that his organizing of opposition to Kagame was risky and could cost him his life. Karegeya said his family was being persecuted: his daughter\'s Rwandan passport was revoked on Kagame\'s orders while she was trying to leave Uganda  where she grew up in exile  and his own quest for work with the United Nations had been obstructed by Kagame.\n\nKagame\'s spokesman and Rwanda\'s foreign minister could not be reached by telephone and did not immediately respond to email requests for comment.\n\nRwandan exiles from the president\'s Tutsi tribe say British  U.S. and Belgian law enforcers have frequently warned them that their government is plotting to kill them. Two British legislators called for Britain to review its relationship with Rwanda in 2011 when they said a Scotland Yard investigation led to the deportation of an alleged Rwandan assassin trying to enter Britain. Two Rwandan exiles said they received warnings from Scotland Yard that the Rwandan government posed an ""imminent threat"" to their lives.\n\nKagame\'s government issued a statement then saying  ""Never does the government of Rwanda threaten the lives of its citizens  nor use violence against its people  wherever they live.""\n\nIn 2012  Sweden and Belgium both deported Rwandan diplomats  Sweden for spying on Rwandan refugees  and Belgium for activities inconsistent with his diplomatic status.\n\nKagame has long been accused of extra-territorial killings  including ones committed when Karegeya was the feared boss of Rwanda\'s external security agency.\n\nIn 1996  former Interior Minister Seth Sendashonga and businessman Augustin Bugirimfura were gunned down in Nairobi  Kenya. Kenya detained a Rwandan diplomat briefly then released him under pressure from Kagame. Also in Nairobi  legislator and former government intelligence chief Theoneste Lizinde was assassinated in 1998. In 2000  presidential adviser Assiel Kabera was shot dead in Kigali  Rwanda\'s capital  reportedly by men in military uniform.\n\n""By killing its opponents  the criminal regime in Kigali seeks to intimidate and silence the Rwandan people into submission "" said an opposition statement signed by Rudasingwa  a former Rwandan ambassador to the United States. ""The regime is hugely mistaken. Such criminal activities make Rwandan people more emboldened to struggle to remove the dictatorship.""\n\nKaregeya and Nyamwasa are among four top former Rwandan army officers  all from Kagame\'s minority Tutsi tribe  who formed an opposition party in exile in 2010. They had fought with Kagame in the Ugandan rebel movement that brought Yoweri Museveni to power in 1986 in Uganda  which is next to Rwanda. Kagame was Museveni\'s intelligence chief and Karegeya was his lieutenant.\n\nMuseveni then allowed them bases and training to form their own Tutsi rebel movement. Kagame\'s Rwandan Patriotic Front came to power in 1994 when it ended Rwanda\'s genocide in which some 800 000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.\n\nKagame\'s supporters  including the United States and Britain  point to his development achievements. Today  Rwanda has some of the best health  literacy and education rates on the continent and is a technology hub. But Rudasingwa said the international community has turned a blind eye to the assassinations and other crimes.\n\nRudasingwa and others have said Kagame ordered the 1994 shooting down of the aircraft carrying the Hutu presidents of Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi  an act that ignited the genocide.\n\nA UN report published in 2010 noted that Kagame refused to have peace talks as thousands of mainly Tutsi Rwandans were being killed  buying the time that allowed his forces to reach Kigali and take control. The same report  which carries a denial from Kagame\'s government  accuses the Rwandan-led forces of ""a possible genocide"" of Rwandan and Congolese Hutus in eastern Congo in the mid-1990s.\n\nAmong questions the writers of the report raised is what role may have been played by the U.S. military  which was training Kagame\'s army. Kagame was trained in U.S. military academies while he was a rebel leader  and his son has been trained in the U.S. since.\n\nRudasingwa  asked by the AP about the complicity of Kagame\'s former allies in the mass killings  did not deny responsibility but said: ""Look at the human rights abuses he (Kagame) has committed since 1994.

We Rwandans have granted ourselves a new beginning.\n\n""We exist in a state of permanent commemoration  every day  in all that we do ... Today  light radiates from this place.""\n\nImage: Belgium\'s Charles Michel  Ethiopia\'s Abiy Ahmed and Jean-Claude Juncker attend a wreath laying ceremony\n\nIn France  President Emmanuel Macron pledged to declare 7 April a national day of commemoration for the genocide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe French president is not attending official commemorations on Sunday but sent Herve Berville  a Tutsi survivor who is a member of the French parliament from Mr Macron\'s ruling party.\n\nMr Kagame has accused Paris of being complicit in the bloodshed.\n\nImage: Rwandan President Paul Kagame (C)  and his wife Jeannette at a commemoration of the 1994 genocide in the capital Kigali\n\nWhile Paris has acknowledged mistakes  it has repeatedly denied allegations it trained militias to take part in the massacre.\n\nFrench high schools will start teaching students about the Rwandan genocide from September 2020  and Mr Macron has appointed researchers to carry out a two-year investigation into the role of the French army in the genocide.\n\nThe commemorations in Rwanda marked the beginning of a week of events to honour the dead.\n\nImage: Sculls of victims of the Rwandan genocide on display inside the church where they were killed\n\nOfficials were due to join around 2 000 people in a ""walk to remember"" from parliament to the national soccer stadium on Sunday afternoon  where candles will be lit in a night vigil.\n\nThe slaughter began on 6 April 1994  after president Juvenal Habyarimana and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi - both Hutus - were killed when their plane was shot down over the Rwandan capital.\n\nThe perpetrators have never been identified.\n\nImage: Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels inspect the wreckage of the president\'s plane  in May 1994\n\nHutu government soldiers and allied militia responded by orchestrating violence with the aim of exterminating the Tutsi minority.\n\nDespite the presence of UN peacekeepers  stationed in the country to oversee the end of a civil war  neighbour turned on neighbour  women and children were hacked to death  burned alive  clubbed and shot.\n\nThe inability of the international community and the UN to prevent  or at least slow the genocide  has been called the ""failure of humanity"".\n\nThe fighting ended in July 1994 when a Tutsi-led rebel force led by Mr Kagame came in from Uganda and took control of the country.\n\nImage: Sculls and personal items of victims of the Rwandan genocide\n\nThe failure of the international community to act decisively in Rwanda has been the subject of much soul searching.\n\nAt the time  much of the focus on international affairs was on the war in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe fighting in Bosnia and Croatia was appearing nightly on western TV screens and governments had committed a considerable number of UN peacekeepers to protect civilians.\n\nAs reports of Rwanda\'s genocide spread through the media  which has been accused of being slow to pick up on the story  the UN Security Council agreed to send more troops.\n\nImage: A visitor looks at an exhibition displaying pictures of victims at the Genocide Memorial in Gisoz\n\nBut  due to delays and bureaucratic failure  the force did not arrive until after the killing had stopped.\n\nA number of commentators  including then secretary general of the UN Boutros Boutros-Ghali  later criticised the West for failing to act.\n\nTony Blair  after he became prime minister  said much later regarding the genocide: ""We knew. We failed to act. We were responsible.""\n\nSome of those who defend the West\'s response say it is difficult to act when the aggressor is not a government and therefore cannot be clearly identified.\n\nSome also say that putting peacekeepers into a situation on the ground where intelligence is incomplete puts the lives of those soldiers at greater risk.\n\nImage: Victims had to be buried in mass graves\n\nThe legacy of Rwanda weighs heavy on the UN however. Western powers had been able to put together forces to intervene  with varying degrees of success  in other conflicts  such as Iraq and Yugoslavia.\n\nIn Rwanda now  an uneasy peace prevails.\n\nOfficial policy is to strongly discourage any talk of ethnicity  but opposition activists say that only happens because Mr Kagame\'s government tightly controls the media and stifles dissent. The government denies this.\n\nYet  people who once were willing to inflict horrific violence against each other are now living side by side.\n\nImage: Children  like these orphans hit by shelling  were caught up in the violence\n\nHutu Tasian Nkundiye  43  murdered his neighbour with a machete  joining with a handful of others to chop a Tutsi man to pieces.\n\nHe spent eight years in prison and now lives near the widow of the man he killed. Somehow they have become friends - their children and grandchildren playing and sharing lunch together.\n\nMr Nkundiye said he is ""grateful"" to his victim\'s 58-year-old widow  Laurencia Mukalemera.\n\n""Ever since I apologised to her after prison life  confessing to my crimes and asking her for forgiveness  she has accepted me "" he said.\n\nImage: Rweru is one of the reconciliation villages Paul Kagame hopes will bring Rwandans together\n\nThey live in one of six ""reconciliation villages""  where genocide survivors and perpetrators live alongside each other.\n\nThe villages are part of Mr Kagame\'s policy of ethnic reconciliation  although some critics say the reconciliation is artificial.\n\nIn the early 2000s  Mr Kagame\'s government brought in laws that allowed those convicted of genocide crimes to leave prison if they apologised to survivors and sought their forgiveness. Mr Nkundiye was released from prison under this arrangement.\n\nImage: Dead Rwandans lie along the side of the road 8 May 1994\n\nHe said: ""What we did was horrible.""\n\nMs Mukalemera  the widow of the man he killed  said: ""I didn\'t know that it was Nkundiye who killed my husband. He came and told me he did it and showed me where my husband\'s body was buried. When he confessed and apologised  I forgave him.\n\n""I found I could not live with anger forever.""\n\nJurisdictions in other countries remain determined to track down those responsible.\n\nImage: Tens of thousands of refugees fled across the border to Tanzania\n\nOn Friday  a Rwandan was convicted in the US of lying about belonging to the political party that led the killings.\n\nJean Leonard Teganya  48  was found guilty of five counts of immigration fraud and perjury \n\nProsecutors  citing witnesses  alleged that during the course of the genocide  Teganya led Hutu soldiers through the hospital to identify Tutsi patients who were then killed. He also personally participated in the killing and raping of Tutsis  prosecutors said.\n\nAt the time of the attacks  archives have shown that British ministers were reluctant for the UK to get involved.\n\nResearcher James White says UN reports viewed the situation as one in which ""the ceasefire had broken down.... rather than one of genocide"".\n\nImage: Hutu refugees fled to camps in Goma in the former Zaire  now the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nMr White said: ""The British media failed to identify the killings as anything other than anarchic and a resumption of the civil war for at least the first three weeks of genocide "" but admitted reporting from Rwanda at the time was difficult and dangerous.\n\nAnother researcher  Peter Dahlgren  suggests that the media reports about Rwanda were like many of those from Africa  ""devoid of social  political and historical context"". Consequently  Mr Dahlgren says  the public were left with a perception about Rwandans ""that\'s just the way they are"".\n\nKey to Britain\'s unwillingness to get involved was the US  which did not support intervention in the early stages.\n\nImage: Bodies lie among belongings and a bike discarded as victims attempted to flee the killing\n\nIn the end  despite Rwanda  as a former colony of Belgium  not being in the Foreign Office\'s sphere of interest  Britain provided logistics and personnel to help the aid effort in the refugee crisis that followed.\n\nSince then  the UK has provided tens of millions of pounds in aid to Rwanda  which the government says has helped lift ""almost 2 million people out of poverty""  and boosted the country so that it is now a major contributor to African peacekeeping missions  ""containing extremism and terrorism"".\n\nAfrica minister Harriet Baldwin said: ""The Rwandan people have shown incredible resilience and unity and I am truly inspired by the transformative progress that Rwanda has made since 1994.\n\n""The UK government is committed to continuing to assist Rwanda\'s recovery from the Genocide: holding perpetrators to account and ensuring justice is achieved.""\n\nImage: Prisoners were allowed to take part in the commemorations in Kigali\n\nThe legacy of the Rwandan genocide continues to shape and influence the UN and foreign policies around the world.\n\nA statement from the African Union  marking the anniversary  said: ""The commemoration of the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda... is annually organised following the decision of the African Union... to reaffirm...

Rwandan leader accused in killing of ex-spy chief - USA TODAY,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/01/02/rwanda-spy-chief-dead/4287373/,"['Rwandan leader accused in killing of ex-spy chief\n\nJOHANNESBURG (AP) — The body of Rwanda\'s former spy chief has been found  possibly strangled  in a hotel in South Africa  police said Thursday. Rwandan dissidents accused President Paul Kagame of ordering his assassination.\n\nThe suspicious death of Patrick Karegeya  a former Kagame ally who turned against him  follows a pattern of assassinations ordered by the Rwandan president  said Theogene Rudasingwa of the opposition coalition Rwandan National Congress. Kagame\'s government vehemently denies it has targeted dissidents.\n\nKaregeya\'s body was discovered in a room at Johannesburg\'s plush Michelangelo Towers hotel on New Year\'s Day  and many questions remain unanswered in a country with a high crime rate.\n\n""He was found in the hotel room dead on the bed "" said a statement from South African police spokeswoman Lt. Col. Katlego Mogale. ""A towel with blood and a rope were found in the hotel room safe. There is a possibility that he might have been strangled."" She said a murder investigation has been opened in the death of the 53-year-old who reportedly fled to South Africa in 2007.\n\nRwandan High Commissioner Vincent Karega told local broadcaster eNCA that talk of assassination is an ""emotional reaction and opportunistic way of playing politics."" He urged people to wait for a report from the South African police.\n\nGunmen twice tried to kill Kagame\'s former chief of army staff  Lt. Gen. Kayumba Nyamwasa  while he was living in exile in Johannesburg in 2010. Nyamwasa told The Associated Press in 2012 that Kagame has hunted him and other dissidents around the world  ""using hired killer squads.""\n\nKaregeya  the former Rwandan intelligence boss  said in a conversation on Nov. 30 with an AP journalist that he understood that his organizing of opposition to Kagame was risky and could cost him his life. Karegeya said his family was being persecuted: his daughter\'s Rwandan passport was revoked on Kagame\'s orders while she was trying to leave Uganda  where she grew up in exile  and his own quest for work with the United Nations had been obstructed by Kagame.\n\nKagame\'s spokesman and Rwanda\'s foreign minister could not be reached by telephone and did not immediately respond to email requests for comment.\n\nRwandan exiles from the president\'s Tutsi tribe say British  U.S. and Belgian law enforcers have frequently warned them that their government is plotting to kill them. Two British legislators called for Britain to review its relationship with Rwanda in 2011 when they said a Scotland Yard investigation led to the deportation of an alleged Rwandan assassin trying to enter Britain. Two Rwandan exiles said they received warnings from Scotland Yard that the Rwandan government posed an ""imminent threat"" to their lives.\n\nKagame\'s government issued a statement then saying  ""Never does the government of Rwanda threaten the lives of its citizens  nor use violence against its people  wherever they live.""\n\nIn 2012  Sweden and Belgium both deported Rwandan diplomats  Sweden for spying on Rwandan refugees  and Belgium for activities inconsistent with his diplomatic status.\n\nKagame has long been accused of extra-territorial killings  including ones committed when Karegeya was the feared boss of Rwanda\'s external security agency.\n\nIn 1996  former Interior Minister Seth Sendashonga and businessman Augustin Bugirimfura were gunned down in Nairobi  Kenya. Kenya detained a Rwandan diplomat briefly then released him under pressure from Kagame. Also in Nairobi  legislator and former government intelligence chief Theoneste Lizinde was assassinated in 1998. In 2000  presidential adviser Assiel Kabera was shot dead in Kigali  Rwanda\'s capital  reportedly by men in military uniform.\n\n""By killing its opponents  the criminal regime in Kigali seeks to intimidate and silence the Rwandan people into submission "" said an opposition statement signed by Rudasingwa  a former Rwandan ambassador to the United States. ""The regime is hugely mistaken. Such criminal activities make Rwandan people more emboldened to struggle to remove the dictatorship.""\n\nKaregeya and Nyamwasa are among four top former Rwandan army officers  all from Kagame\'s minority Tutsi tribe  who formed an opposition party in exile in 2010. They had fought with Kagame in the Ugandan rebel movement that brought Yoweri Museveni to power in 1986 in Uganda  which is next to Rwanda. Kagame was Museveni\'s intelligence chief and Karegeya was his lieutenant.\n\nMuseveni then allowed them bases and training to form their own Tutsi rebel movement. Kagame\'s Rwandan Patriotic Front came to power in 1994 when it ended Rwanda\'s genocide in which some 800 000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.\n\nKagame\'s supporters  including the United States and Britain  point to his development achievements. Today  Rwanda has some of the best health  literacy and education rates on the continent and is a technology hub. But Rudasingwa said the international community has turned a blind eye to the assassinations and other crimes.\n\nRudasingwa and others have said Kagame ordered the 1994 shooting down of the aircraft carrying the Hutu presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi  an act that ignited the genocide.\n\nA U.N. report published in 2010 noted that Kagame refused to have peace talks as thousands of mainly Tutsi Rwandans were being killed  buying the time that allowed his forces to reach Kigali and take control. The same report  which carries a denial from Kagame\'s government  accuses the Rwandan-led forces of ""a possible genocide"" of Rwandan and Congolese Hutus in eastern Congo in the mid-1990s.\n\nAmong questions the writers of the report raised is what role may have been played by the U.S. military  which was training Kagame\'s army. Kagame was trained in U.S. military academies while he was a rebel leader  and his son has been trained in the U.S. since.\n\nRudasingwa  asked by the AP about the complicity of Kagame\'s former allies in the mass killings  did not deny responsibility but said: ""Look at the human rights abuses he (Kagame) has committed since 1994. Why has he  including myself and Patrick Karegeya and all of us  why … wouldn\'t the international community call all of us to account?""\n\nHe added that ""We don\'t fear justice.""\n\nRudasingwa said he long has warned the United States  Britain and other Kagame supporters that their efforts to bring peace to eastern Congo will be for naught unless they address the problems in Rwanda. Most recently  Kagame has denied a U.N. report that his government has trained and supplied M23 rebels in eastern Congo.\n\nRudasingwa said international support for Kagame is helping ""to put Rwanda on a course for another bloody conflict but the international community appears to not be interested in preventing another bloodbath in Rwanda.""']",rwandan leader accuse kill ex spy chief n

Rwanda asylum seekers will use people smugglers for deadly trip back to ...,https://inews.co.uk/news/rwanda-asylum-seekers-people-smugglers-back-uk-1685927,['Exclusive\n\nAsylum seekers sent from the UK to Rwanda will flee the African country and risk death by using people-smuggling gangs to reach Europe again  the country’s opposition leader has said.\n\nVictoire Ingabire Umuhoza branded the government of Rwanda a “dictatorial regime” which “doesn’t care” about asylum seekers being sent from Britain.\n\nShe accused the UK Government of breaching the UN’s 1951 Refugee Convention over its Rwanda policy and said she was “surprised” to learn about the Home Office scheme  which is costing UK taxpayers £120m over five years.\n\n“The Government of Rwanda knows that these refugees will not stay in Rwanda ” Ms Ingabire told i . “This is why they accepted this deal.”\n\nMs Ingabire  53  a leading critic of President Paul Kagame  spent eight years in prison after being convicted in 2010 of genocide denial following her return to Rwanda from exile to take part in presidential elections.\n\n“This is a dictatorial regime ” she said. “All the power is in the hands of President Kagame. The justice  the judges are not free  we have a parliament that can’t do anything or make any decisions.”\n\nWhen asked about the threat of asylum seekers turning to people smugglers to leave Rwanda after they are deported there  Ms Ingabire pointed to the estimated 4 000 asylum seekers deported from Israel to Rwanda and Uganda under a secret deal from 2014 to 2017 as proof that most who arrive from the UK will also leave.\n\nThe majority escaped almost immediately  with many attempting to return to Europe via people-smuggling routes.\n\n“Where are the refugees that Israel sent to Rwanda? They are no longer in Rwanda ” she said. “They left and went back in Europe.\n\n“That will happen again with these refugees that the UK will send to Rwanda. They will not be in prison – they have a right to go where they want.\n\n“That means they will not stay in Rwanda and the Government of Rwanda knows that.”\n\nIn 2018  an Oxford University study found that Eritrean and Sudanese migrants sent by Israel to Rwanda and Uganda made a “dangerous journey” through South Sudan  Sudan and Libya en route to Europe.\n\nDuring the journey  they were subjected to human trafficking  incarceration  the threat of forcible deportation to Eritrea  harsh conditions of starvation  violence and slavery in torture camps in Libya.\n\nAfter that  they then faced a dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Europe.\n\nMs Ingabire  a member of the Hutu ethnic group  was handed a 15-year jail sentence after questioning why Rwanda’s official memorial to the 1994 genocide did not include any Hutus.\n\nFive of her eight years in jail were spent in solitary confinement before her release under a presidential pardon in 2018. She is unable to leave the country  with the Government barring her from visiting her husband and children in the Netherlands.\n\nVictoire Ingabire Umuhoza branded the Government of Rwanda a ‘dictatorial regime’ which ‘doesn’t care’ about asylum seekers being sent from Britain. (Photo: supplied)\n\nThe leader of the opposition Dalfa-Umurinzi party believes her conviction was politically motivated.\n\n“Everybody knows Rwanda is known to be a country where democracy and human rights are not respected ” she said.\n\n“The British Government know it  they know Rwanda’s government does not respect human rights and they decided to send refugees to a country like Rwanda.\n\n“The Geneva Convention says you can’t send refugees to a country when you know their liberty could be in danger.”\n\nShe said that four members of the opposition have been killed and four disappeared in recent years  with the Rwandan government unable to provide answers.\n\n“In two years  four members from the political party have disappeared and four others were killed ” she said.\n\n“Until today  the Rwanda government cannot explain who killed these people. The problem is only members of the opposition were killed. Nobody from the ruling party was killed or disappeared  only members of the opposition.”\n\nShe believes that asylum seekers “don’t have a future in Rwanda” and questioned what will happen at the end of the UK Government’s five-year trial scheme.\n\n“I am wondering what will happen after five years if the British Government will no longer pay the Rwanda government ” she said.\n\n“The British government now pays for where they stay. If the British Government stops giving this money what will happen with them?\n\n“Many young people in Rwanda don’t have a job. This doesn’t mean that the government has jobs to offer these refugees. Rwanda is a poor country.”\n\nA UK Government spokesperson said: “Rwanda is a safe country and has previously been recognised for providing a safe haven for refugees – we will not be deterred in delivering our plans to fix the broken asylum system which will ultimately save lives.”'],exclusive n nasylum seeker send uk rwanda flee african country risk death use people smuggle gang reach europe country opposition leader say n nvictoire ingabire umuhoza brand government rwanda dictatorial regime doesnt care asylum seeker send britain n nshe accuse uk government breach uns refugee convention rwanda policy say surprised learn home office scheme cost uk taxpayer five year n nthe government rwanda know refugee stay rwanda ms ingabire tell accepted deal n nm ingabire lead critic president paul kagame spend eight year prison convict genocide denial follow return rwanda exile take part presidential election n nthis dictatorial regime say power hand president kagame justice judge free parliament cant anything make decision n nwhen ask threat asylum seeker turn people smuggler leave rwanda deport ms ingabire point estimate asylum seeker deport israel rwanda uganda secret deal proof arrive uk also leave n nthe majority escape almost immediately many attempt return europe via people smuggle route n nwhere refugees israel send rwanda longer rwanda say leave go back europe n nthat happen refugee uk send rwanda prison right go want n nthat mean stay rwanda government rwanda know n nin oxford university study find eritrean sudanese migrant send israel rwanda uganda make dangerous journey south sudan sudan libya en route europe n nduring journey subject human traffic incarceration threat forcible deportation eritrea harsh condition starvation violence slavery torture camp libya n nafter face dangerous cross mediterranean sea libya europe n nms ingabire member hutu ethnic group hand year jail sentence question rwanda official memorial genocide include hutu n nfive eight year jail spend solitary confinement release presidential pardon unable leave country government bar visit husband child netherlands n nvictoire ingabire umuhoza brand government rwanda dictatorial regime doesnt care asylum seeker send britain photo supply n nthe leader opposition dalfa umurinzi party believe conviction politically motivate n neverybody know rwanda know country democracy human right respect say n nthe british government know know rwandas government respect human right decide send refugee country like rwanda n nthe geneva convention say cant send refugee country know liberty could danger n nshe say four member opposition kill four disappeared recent year rwandan government unable provide answer n nin two year four member political party disappear four others kill say n nuntil today rwanda government can not explain killed people problem member opposition kill nobody rule party kill disappeared member opposition n nshe believe asylum seeker dont future rwanda question happen end uk government five year trial scheme n ni wonder happen five year british government long pay rwanda government say n nthe british government pay stay british government stop give money happen n nmany young people rwanda dont job doesnt mean government job offer refugee rwanda poor country n na uk government spokesperson say rwanda safe country previously recognise provide safe refugee deter deliver plan fix break asylum system ultimately save life,0.5502386067929057,1

"The epidemiology of road traffic injury hotspots in Kigali, Rwanda from ...",https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3359-4,['To our knowledge  this is the first in-depth evaluation of the epidemiology of RTCs in the Kigali region using GIS hotspot analysis from police data. Our findings demonstrated that the majority of RTC drivers were middle-aged (20 to 45 years) males. Risk of grievous injury increased with each year of decreasing age. The majority of crashes included cars and trucks  followed by buses and motorcycles. Primary victims of crashes were mainly in cars  on motorcycles  and pedestrians and cyclists. Pedestrians and cyclists  as well as motorcyclists had significantly increased odds of grievous injuries compared to car passengers.\n\nGlobally  the majority of RTCs and grievous injuries occur in young males which is also reflected in our data. While this is reflected in other studies worldwide and in Africa  but at 92.5 %  the percentage of male RTC victims in Kigali is significantly higher than worldwide estimates of 77 % [4  18]. This is likely due to a larger percentage of male drivers in Kigali and in the country of Rwanda; there is a 10 fold higher number of licenses issued to males compared to females [10]. Despite the number of registered motorized 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles outnumbering cars in Rwanda at 43 944 compared to 40 585 cars [4]  in this study we found the percentage of crashes involving by motorcycles was less than half of those caused by cars. These findings echo those from a recent systematic review evaluating road traffic deaths by user found which found that 49 % of all road traffic deaths in the World Health Organization African subregion D  which includes Rwanda  were from motorized 4-wheeled vehicles and only 16 % secondary to motorcycles [27]. In our study  although fewer RTCs were caused by motorcycles  motorcycle riders were found to have significantly higher risk of grievous injury  indicating that despite the introduction of legislature with helmet laws and limiting the number of riders on motorcycles  there should be continued focus motorcycle users and prevention of RTCs.\n\nOur calculated numbers of injuries differed starkly from the numbers calculated in the Rwanda Statistical Yearbook from the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda for the same year. Using police data for the country  the National Institute of Statistics determined that nationwide  the number of RTIs from motorcycles was double that of cars. Additionally  they estimated the total number of recorded injured persons from RTCs nationally in 2013 at 2609 with 315 deaths. Our data found 2589 crashes with 4687 victims  of which 685 were injured with 85 fatalities [28]. There are several possible causes for this  beginning with the large number of missing reports from the police registry. Data collection proved problematic owing to the paper reports completed by the traffic police and the limited availability of only one paper chart per traffic crash. An electronic database or production of permanent copies in a centralized database could help maintain accurate statistics. Additionally  there is a concern for inaccurate reporting at the city and/or national level police datasets  particularly given that most reports describe the majority of RTIs as occurring in Kigali. It is also possible that rural areas with fewer resources may not report RTCs as often as more centralized urban areas. Although previous studies have evaluated rates of underreporting RTCs in more urban areas  limited work has been done in rural areas  and none that we know of in Rwanda [29  30]. Underreporting of data on RTIs is not only limited to Rwanda  but is a problem throughout Africa and other LMICs [30–34]. The WHO suggests linking of data sources such as police  insurance  and registration records to improve data on road traffic deaths  however only a handful of primarily high-income countries use this method to determine official fatality rates. Data on non-fatal RTIs is even more disparate owing to variations of definitions and data collection methods [35]. In Rwanda  a quality analysis of police data in addition to surveys of the community could yield additional information in determining discrepancies in data or reasons for underreporting of data by the public.\n\nGeospatial analysis demonstrated that most of the hotspots are clustered around the intersection of the three districts of Kigali Province and seem to follow 2 major highways that traverse the city  RN3 and RN15  in addition to roads KN3 and KN5  near the Kigali International Airport. When separated by severity of injury  grievous injuries are noted to occur more in larger roads or highways  intersections  and densely populated areas of Kigali. This is likely due to increased speed on the highway and larger roads with an increased pedestrian and vulnerable road user density. Considering these distinct hotspots and the WHO literature suggesting road safety audits  the next area of research should be conducting a built environment analysis at these locations to identify more specific causes of risk for road users [4].\n\nIt has been suggested that many of the problems leading to RTIs in Sub-Saharan Africa center around politics  cost  resources  and enforcement [36]. The Rwandan government made vast improvements to infrastructure and began implementing road safety programs following the genocide in the 90s. The most significant changes included seatbelt laws  vehicle inspections  and speed limits in addition to overhauling law enforcement by cracking down on police corruption and increasing police resources. Additionally  Rwanda was one of the first African countries to implement helmet laws and to limit the number of riders on motorcycles. These changes led to significant overall reductions in mortality from RTIs  including markedly lower rates of motorcycle crashes compared to other LMIC countries but rates of RTIs still remain significantly higher compared to Western countries [4  37]. The goal of our project was to not only conduct a hotspot analysis which will provide the platform for conducting a built environment analysis in Kigali Rwanda  but to evaluate the quality of police data in Rwanda for this methods. Most LMIC have limited quality so this method is challenging. The next steps for this project in Rwanda are to conduct the built environment analyses at our stated hotspots as well as safety program planning. Similarly  further investigation and initiatives specifically for VRUs like motorcyclists and pedestrians are needed  particularly because of their risk of grievous injury. Even with the obvious data quality challenges  given the high rates of geolocation of crash sites from the police data  Rwanda could serve as a model for other LMIC police data collection.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe RTC reports analyzed in this study were obtained from the Kigali Traffic Police and therefore subject to the completeness of their database. The traffic reports consist of single paper copies  therefore they were unavailable if an RTC was not reported  or if it was being investigated or processed by the courts or insurance providers. Of note  grievous RTCs and those resulting in substantial property damage are anecdotally reported to make up the majority of RTCs that are brought to the judicial system. Once a report is sent to the judicial system it effectively disappears from Kigali Traffic Police and is never returned. This limitation could substantially impact the ability of our results to reflect the true nature of RTC hotspots in Kigali and the true number of grievous versus non-grievous RTIs in this study. There was no way to verify the suggested non-random nature of missing information due to the limited nature of those missing sheets or the register log. Similarly  missing data was present in our overall cohort; most notably  we were not able to identify geolocation of 14.6 % of our data. Road conditions were also missing and some data was likely missing in our overall cohort. Previous studies have demonstrated underreporting of RTCs to police in LMICs [16  30]. Future studies could involve combining information from hospital records and insurance claims for a more complete representation of RTCs. Additionally  given that the injury severity is subjectively determined by police officers rather than trained healthcare personnel  the extent of grievous injuries may be limited. Although we were able to obtain information on the numbers of new licenses issued per year by gender  we were unable to find data regarding the ages of licensed individuals. This limits our ability to compare injury severity in the context of licensed individuals.\n\nWhile the best approach to understand determinants for road traffic injury hotspots would be to control for exposure in each location  in a LMIC setting such data is not always readily available. Limitations with the quality of data  volume of road users  and commuting characteristics restrict our ability to fully evaluate these hotspots. A geospatial analysis based on areas (instead of points) could be used to control for population  but this was not the goal of the paper. Instead  our goal was a more commonly used point distribution analysis for identifying hotspots. Although we did not control for exposure  our methodologic approach was able to identify the locations with the highest density of crashes. Future research will focus on these variables in order to further characterize the built environment and determine potential changes to reduce crashes.'],knowledge first depth evaluation epidemiology

A.K.A Gasongo and his colleague Hamimu Niyonkuru aggressively packed into Kimironko sector’s security and hygiene car.\n\nRukundo was injured on his head due to a violent-forced action of packing him in a car after the duo were asking for their payment from a liquor club called “Magestic liquor & Wine” located in Nyagatovu cell.\n\nThe incident took place on Friday midnight around 12 am.\n\nThe men who were not also in a good position due to alcohol consumption at that moment were coming to ask for their payment from the club owner after they made chairs for her and instead of paying them called District Administration Security Support Organ (DASSO) from Kimironko sector who came in a while by taking the men as if there were stones and put in a car where Rukundo’s head was injured.\n\nEye witnesses who were there criticize such a security organ (DASSO) for usual illegal action of violating human beings’ health instead of playing the role of gathering peace and security.\n\nRukundo works with his colleague Niyonkuru who was taken as detainee at Kimironko police station after the incident occurred.\n\nLouise Uwimbabazi is the servant at the club who was there during the incident.\n\nShe confirmed to The Inspirer that security organs who intervened behaved inhuman while packing the men in a car  injuring Rukundo who did not even fight with anybody before.\n\n“I do not understand why you are asking me where the man was injured from  he was injured after being taken in a car by Security officials  and yourself have been there ” Louise told the journalist.\n\nTrying to chat with Kimironko sector’s DASSO security organ in the morning soon after the incident  they said they had nothing to report and recommended the journalist to contact the executive secretary.\n\nNyiridandi Mapambano  Kimironko sector’s executive secretary on phone call with The Inspirer said that the man was injured by his colleague after both were fighting  which is not true as the journalist himself was at the incident’s place as the eye witness.\n\n“The man was injured as they were fighting themselves and they were drunkard  security organs went there to intervene after being called by observers  they were both taken to Kimironko police station and the one who was injured was taken later to Kibagabaga hospital by the sectors’ security and hygiene car to be handled ” said Nyiridandi.\n\n“We will follow up to see the way those men were transported and punish kind of illegal conduct on how they detained those people  we have the entity that punishes them as other employees of the district  whenever they act in contrary to the ethical regulations of their work ” he added.\n\nWe tried later to visit the police station of Kimironko where Hamimu Niyonkuru was under arrest and the police officer refused to let us talk with the detainee  saying that they will follow on DASSO who committed such a critical intervention.\n\nAs we proceeded to Kibagabaga hospital where Rukundo who was injured was taken in the same morning  a medical official said that the patient refused to be treated as he was in a mood of drunkard  saying that he is not sick.\n\nSpeaking to Niyonkuru today  he said he was released by police yesterday after some hours in prison.\n\nHe said security officials’ intervention for security matters remains critical as they detain innocent people instead of handling their problems.\n\n“I was coming to ask my money for the job I did for the bar owner  she refused to answer my phone call until the night  and we came to wait for her at the club  my colleague who I employed was also asking me for his pay  we had not even transport to go home  they came to detain me saying we were causing security shortage  it was between 11 and 12 midnight ” said Niyonkuru.\n\nNiyonkuru also criticizes the way DASSO security organ handles issues related to security while on their usual interventions.\n\n“DASSO are used to mistreating people when they are called for security intervention as they look the noble’s side instead of following on the root cause of the issue on the ground ” he said.\n\nThe bar owner who

What makes this disaster even worse  is the fact that Rwandans already faced similar catastrophic event this year.\n\nThis time  Rwandan Red Cross Society was ready to take action immediately after the first winds and raindrops hit the area. Unfortunately  they could only do so much and the storms killed 3 people and injured 24. The survivors have been relocated to safe locations  though left without homes  or any life belongings  just what they could take in a hurry with them  during the evacuation.\n\nAccording to data from a rapid assessment conducted by Rwanda Red Cross staff and volunteers  it is estimated that 5 850 people from 1 170 households have been affected by heavy winds and out of them 640 families are now homeless and classified as most vulnerable.\n\nThe affected families are currently accommodated in the nearby communities after their homes were damaged and a variety of household materials  shelters and clothing destroyed  leaving the affected population without basic necessities and means. Household bedding materials were also destroyed  creating the need for blankets  sleeping mats and other essential non-food items.\n\nIt has been reported that an estimated of 1 024 ha (2 530 acres) of mixed crops (including banana trees and cassava plants) were destroyed  and household food stocks were completely damaged. As a result  a lack of access to food stuff presents a situation that may result in short-term food insecurity  especially for chronically ill people  the elderly  female-headed households  lactating mothers and under-five children  pregnant women  and single parents.\n\nFurthermore  latrines and other sanitation infrastructure were also destroyed  increasing the risk of diseases outbreak  particularly during the current rainy season.\n\nFeatured image: Kigali flood  Rwanda (file photo).'],start september several province rwanda strike severe storm rain cause major damage take several life force people home n nthe unfortunate event begin around local time province nyamasheke rusizi huye bugesera ngoma kirehe gicumbi rubavu nyabihu heavy rain wind destroy farm house property common people area n nstorms bring damage rusizi nyamasheke ngom bugesera huye affect area make disaster even bad fact rwandan already face similar catastrophic event year n nthis time rwandan red cross society ready take action immediately first wind raindrops hit area unfortunately could much storm killed people injured survivor relocate safe location though leave without home life belonging could take hurry evacuation n naccording data rapid assessment conduct rwanda red cross staff volunteer estimate people household affect heavy wind family homeless classify vulnerable n nthe affected family currently accommodate nearby community home damage variety household material shelter clothe destroy leave affected population without basic necessity mean household bedding material also destroy create need blanket sleep mat essential non food item n nit report estimate ha acre mixed crop include banana tree cassava plant destroy household food stock completely damage result lack access food stuff present situation may result short term food insecurity especially chronically ill people elderly female head household lactate mother five child pregnant woman single parent n nfurthermore latrines sanitation infrastructure also destroy increase risk disease outbreak particularly current rainy season n nfeatured image kigali flood rwanda file photo,0.8649710775416807,1

It was organized from 23 to 25 October 2018 in the capital city of Kigali.\n\nThough Rwanda is not in the midst of a war  the country receives a number of wounded patients from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Burundi due to the displacements.\n\nMost of the wounded refugees who arrive in Rwanda for medical assistance are mainly transferred to three national referral hospitals – Rwanda Military Hospital and King Faisal Hospital in Kigali city and Gisenyi District Hospital  which is in Western province bordering the DRC.\n\nLooking at the need for specialized surgical skills  the seminar equipped the participants with the knowledge to provide the wounded patients with adequate and timely care. It also served as a forum for experience-sharing among the medical staff.\n\nDr Françoise Mukagaju  a general surgeon at King Faisal Hospital  appreciated the course module  saying she was happy to attend it because it provided her with specific and new skills to treat those wounded in conflict.

"Hutu rebels accuse DRC, Rwanda after Italian ambassador killed - Al Jazeera",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/23/hutu-rebels-accuse-drc-rwanda-over-italians-killing,['Luca Attanasio died of his wounds after a World Food Programme convoy came under fire near the eastern city of Goma.\n\nRwandan Hutu rebels denied allegations they were behind the killing of the Italian ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and instead accused the armies of the DRC and Rwanda of responsibility.\n\nAn Italian Carabinieri unit  meanwhile  was expected in DRC on Tuesday to investigate.\n\nLuca Attanasio died of his wounds on Monday after a World Food Programme (WFP) convoy came under fire near the eastern city of Goma while he was on a field trip. The Italian government said an Italian policeman  Vittorio Iacovacci  and a driver it did not identify also died.\n\nDRC’s interior ministry blamed the killings on “members of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda [FDLR]”  a Rwandan Hutu rebel group that has plagued the region for more than a quarter of a century.\n\nBut the FDLR rejected the allegation in a statement received by AFP news agency on Tuesday.\n\nIt said the ambassador’s convoy was attacked near the Rwandan border  “not far from a position of the FARDC [DRC’s armed forces] and Rwandan soldiers”.\n\n“The responsibility for this despicable killing is to be found in the ranks of these two armies and their sponsors who have forged an unnatural alliance to perpetuate the pillaging of eastern DRC ” it said.\n\nThe FDLR denied “being involved in the attack” and called on Kinshasa and UN peacekeeping force MONUSCO to “shed light” on the killings “instead of resorting to hasty accusations”.\n\nDRC and Rwanda authorities have not reported the presence of any regular Rwandan troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nBut an analyst at the Kivu Security Tracker  a US monitor  said: “The FDLR are near the place where the attack took place. It’s in the realm of possibility that the Rwandan rebels are responsible for this attack.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAttacks increasing\n\nIt is unusual for a top diplomat to be targeted in eastern DRC  but attacks have been rising  Pierre Boisselet  coordinator of the Kivu Security Tracker  said.\n\n“Attacks on humanitarians and kidnappings of humanitarian workers have been increasing. Last year we recorded 12 of those incidents in North and South Kivu  but only one ended in a death ” he said.\n\n“Usually violence by armed groups targets civilians ” or civilians are hurt amid clashes between armed groups and the army.\n\nThe attack  25km (15 miles) north of Goma  was right next to Virunga National Park.\n\nDRC’s interior ministry said four other people in the convoy were kidnapped  but one person was found by the army.\n\nThe UN vehicles were hijacked by the attackers and taken into the bush. The Congolese army and park guards for Virunga National Park responded to the attack and there was an exchange of fire  according to North Kivu Governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita.\n\n‘Heinous targeting’\n\nAttanasio was shot in the abdomen and was then transported to the UN Mission in Congo hospital where he died from his wounds  according to the interior ministry. The driver and police officer died at the scene.\n\nThe WFP said the attack occurred on a road that had been cleared previously for travel without security escorts  and it was seeking more information from local officials on the attack.\n\nUN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said the determination of whether roads are safe is normally made by UN security officials in the country.\n\nHe said he had no details on “the exact unfolding of the incident ” and “the investigation will bring  hopefully  clarity to that”.\n\nAttanasio  43  represented Italy in Kinshasa since 2017  first as head of mission and then as ambassador from October 2019.\n\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella described the ambush as a “cowardly attack.”\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a statement urging the DRC to swiftly investigate a “heinous targeting” of a UN mission.\n\nI strongly condemn the attack against a @WFP joint field mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which resulted in the killing of the Italian Ambassador to the country  his bodyguard & a WFP colleague.

Rwandas Khashoggi: who killed the exiled spy chief?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/15/rwanda-who-killed-patrick-karegeya-exiled-spy-chief,['In five-star hotels  the “Do Not Disturb” sign exerts a strange kind of magic. Privacy is the rich man’s prerequisite  and staff are trained never to enter a room when the sign dangles off the door handle  whatever they suspect might be taking place within: a session with a professional escort  a drug deal  an alcoholic binge. None of their business.\n\nThe Michelangelo hotel  in Johannesburg’s upmarket Sandton district  looks a tad dated these days  but it is still one of the most popular meeting places for African government ministers  celebrities and local VIPs – the kind of establishment that prides itself on its discretion. So when  on 1 January 2014  a young Rwandan accountant called David Batenga turned up at the Michelangelo and demanded that staff open room 905  the initial reaction was blank refusal. The guest had hung out the “Do Not Disturb” sign  the receptionist told him.\n\nBut Batenga insisted. The room had been booked by his uncle  Patrick Karegeya  Rwanda’s former head of external intelligence  on behalf of a young businessman friend visiting from Rwanda  Apollo Kiririsi Gafaranga. Batenga was his uncle’s fixer  occasional driver and confidante  so he knew that for a few days  Karegeya had been shuttling from his house in a gated community to the Michelangelo for drinks and meals with Apollo.\n\nIn South Africa the Christmas and new year break is a time when schools  shops and government offices close and everyone heads for the beach. Karegeya had moved his family to the US a few years earlier out of concern for their safety  so he was hungry for company. The visit of Apollo  a young man with something of a playboy reputation  had looked just the ticket.\n\nBut now Karegeya wasn’t picking up calls or answering messages – unusual behaviour for a man who was rarely off his various smartphones. He hadn’t even called his wife and their three children to wish them a happy new year. It was totally out of character. Batenga had spotted his uncle’s car sitting in the Michelangelo’s parking lot  he told the hotel receptionist – he must be on the premises.\n\nBatenga paced  he nagged  he wheedled  he refused to leave. “I become an asshole. I was literally there the entire day ” he recalled. The hours ticked by and  eventually  sheer mulishness won out. Rolling their eyes  staff at reception finally agreed to call in the police to check the room. When they summoned Batenga over to the desk  their expressions were grim. The whole atmosphere had changed. “Your guest is dead  sir ” one of them announced.\n\nInside room 905  where the television was playing at full volume  Karegeya lay on his back on the double bed  his hands on either side of his face  streaks of dried blood around his nose and ears. Normally light-skinned  his complexion had turned livid: he’d almost certainly been strangled  then covered in a duvet. A curtain cord and a bloodied towel had been stuffed into the room’s safe. Apollo was gone.\n\nApollo  Karegeya’s family and friends claim  had been the decoy in a carefully prepared trap. Karegeya had been a key member of the rebel group that took control of Rwanda after the genocide in 1994  and was appointed head of external intelligence by Paul Kagame  Rwanda’s leader and his longtime friend. But he fell out with Kagame and fled the country in 2008  setting up an opposition party in exile in South Africa. Apollo befriended Karegeya and the two became drinking buddies in Johannesburg – Karegeya’s grieving family suspect on direct orders from Rwandan intelligence.\n\nKaregeya had every reason to believe that the regime he had done so much to establish was now out to kill him. He and the other three founders of the opposition party in exile  the Rwanda National Congress (RNC)  had been tried in absentia by a military court in Rwanda  which found them guilty of threatening state security and sentenced them to 24-year prison terms. One of the charges – which all four denied – was responsibility for a spate of grenade attacks in Rwanda’s capital  Kigali  in 2010.\n\nSeveral Rwandans in South Africa had warned Karegeya that they had received calls from military intelligence in Kigali seeking to hire contract killers. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa  one of the other founders of the RNC  General Kayumba Nyamwasa – former chief of staff of the Rwandan army – was shot in the stomach in a failed assassination attempt as he returned from a shopping trip in Johannesburg with his wife. The South African authorities had immediately assigned the two high-profile political exiles 24-hour protection.\n\nBut Karegeya had sent his government bodyguards packing. A freewheeling  irreverent spirit  he found the constant supervision unbearable and decided instead to rely on his decades of intelligence experience and network of contacts to keep a step ahead of his enemies. One basic rule: all meetings must take place in public. He had apparently broken that rule on New Year’s Eve at the Michelangelo.\n\n“The only way they could get to my uncle was via a friend ” said Batenga. “To get him into that room  it had to be someone he trusted implicitly. That was always Uncle’s weak point  and they knew it: the faith he placed in his friends.”\n\nThe reaction to Karegeya’s murder in Rwanda – especially among his former friends and colleagues – was jarringly gleeful. “When you choose to be a dog  you die like a dog ” Rwanda’s defence minister declared  “and the cleaners will wipe away the trash so that it does not stink.” The country’s prime minister  Pierre Habumuremyi  said: “Betraying citizens and their country that made you a man shall always bear consequences to you.” When Karegeya’s daughter expressed her shock at the triumphalist celebration of her father’s murder  Rwanda’s foreign minister  Louise Mushikiwabo  replied with a tweet: “This man was a self-declared enemy of Gov & my country  U expect pity?”\n\nWhen quizzed by a western reporter  Kagame delivered an answer calculated for the benefit of his country’s international allies and donors. “Rwanda did not kill this person – and it’s a big ‘no’.” Yet he could not resist a follow-up: “But I add that  I actually wish Rwanda did it. I really wish it.”\n\nKagame’s message to Rwanda’s domestic audience was far more direct. He chose to deliver it  of all places  at a prayer breakfast in Kigali  and it was presented with an admonishing finger and a cold smile. “Whoever betrays the country will pay the price  I assure you ” he told a small crowd of nervous-looking dignitaries and their wives.\n\n“Any person still alive who may be plotting against Rwanda  whoever they are  will pay the price ” Kagame said. “Whoever it is  it is a matter of time.”\n\nThis week  five years after Karegeya’s murder  an inquest into what happened at the Michelangelo hotel will finally open in a high court in Randburg  a north-west suburb of Johannesburg. State prosecutor Yusuf Baba has told magistrate Jeremiah Matopa he intends calling at least 30 witnesses. Hearings are expected to stretch into February.\n\nKaregeya’s grieving family  friends and colleagues hope the inquest will  at the very least  result in arrest warrants for the killers – suspected to be a team who fled back to Rwanda. Since none of the suspects are believed to be resident in South Africa  that would require official requests for their extradition. The key issue  though  is whether the inquest will address the possibility of a political motive and state collusion in the assassination.\n\n“This is South Africa’s Khashoggi ” a member of the South African judiciary told me. “And by rights  it should receive the same kind of press coverage and raise the same kind of questions.” The murder of the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey last October prompted worldwide condemnation – but there was only a brief spasm of conscience among allies and trading partners of the Saudi monarchy before business as usual largely resumed.\n\nThe inquest into Karegeya’s killing will raise thornier ethical questions about the engagement between western donor nations and the countries emerging from civil war and famine  many of them African  they seek to help. The 1994 Rwanda genocide  in which up to a million Tutsis and Hutus died  was sparked when President Juvenal Habyarimana’s jet was downed by a missile whose provenance remains hotly disputed. As fighting escalated  the UN actually evacuated its peacekeeping force from the country. Western states that did nothing to prevent the massacres have treated Rwanda with kid gloves ever since  in part out of a frequently acknowleged sense of guilt.\n\nAfter the genocide  Kagame was hailed as one of Africa’s “renaissance” leaders  along with Yoweri Museveni of Uganda  Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea and Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia. These were all men who had seized power at the barrel of the gun  but who were considered visionary social and political reformers  dedicated to raising up “the poorer of the poor”. In recognition of what many saw as a unique  and inspiring  collaboration between western funders and African recipients  they were dubbed “donor darlings”.\n\nPatrick Karegeya in Kigali. Photograph: AP\n\nThe passing decades have rubbed the gloss off both Museveni and Isaias  while much of Meles’ legacy is being briskly dismantled in Ethiopia by a new prime minister. That leaves Kagame – whose country of 13 million people annually receives $1.1bn in aid – as the most prominent champion of a brand of authoritarian economic development embraced by many aid officials but deplored by human rights activists.\n\nBut Kagame’s tenure has been dogged by controversy ever since his rebel army  the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)  seized control of the country in July 1994. In the years after the genocide  international criticism focused on brutal events in the forests of eastern Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo  or DRC) where the RPF hunted down those who had committed the genocide  slaughtering alongside them hundreds of thousands of Hutu civilians.\n\nMore recently  concerns have shifted to the regime’s relentless pursuit of journalists  opposition politicians and social activists  whether inside Rwanda or living in exile. Karegeya’s assassination  human rights groups allege  was just part of a widespread campaign of extra-judicial killings  kidnappings  renditions  beatings  death threats and surveillance waged abroad with impunity.\n\n“This inquest is making Kagame really jittery ” said David Himbara  who once worked as Kagame’s economic adviser and now runs a Rwandan pro-democracy group from Canada. “It happens to coincide with a surge in US concern over human rights in Rwanda  and some very aggressive rhetoric from Kagame. It’s going to remind the world of Rwanda’s record on human rights just when he wants the issue forgotten.”\n\nPublic examination of exactly how Patrick Karegeya died will shed light on the chasm between Rwanda’s impressive achievements in alleviating poverty and its record of suppressing political freedom. The process is likely to reignite a long-simmering debate about how far the global development industry is willing to compromise moral principles in the service of stability.\n\nWho wanted Patrick Karegeya dead? What is striking about this story is the intimacy of the links that bind its protagonists. Karegeya  Kayumba and Kagame were all Tutsis  part of a Kinyarwanda-speaking community whose territory historically fans out from Rwanda  spreading into the Congo  Burundi  Uganda and Tanzania. Traditionally  a Tutsi minority made up Rwanda’s cattle-keeping aristocracy  while Hutu serfs tended to crops. In 1959  an emerging Hutu elite enjoying the support of both colonial Belgium and the Catholic church launched a revolution. The Tutsi royal family was ousted and hundreds of thousands of Tutsis  running from Hutu persecution  settled in neighbouring countries.\n\nKagame  who is of royal blood  grew up in a Ugandan refugee camp dependent on food rations  bitterly aware of his family’s fall from grace. Karegeya and Kayumba  by contrast  both came from well-integrated Ugandan Tutsi families. But as youngsters during the 1970s they all bumped into one another at festivals  weddings and market days. Karegeya and Kagame attended the same secondary school in Kampala. In the early 1980s  when the Ugandan president Milton Obote began victimising their community  all three joined the armed resistance led by Museveni  an ambitious leftist revolutionary.\n\nTheir plan was to learn how to fight  in order to return home. Once Museveni seized power in Kampala in 1986  these trusted Tutsi cadres established their clandestine army-in-waiting  the RPF  within the Ugandan military. For four years they raised money and made plans. In October 1990  taking advantage of Museveni’s absence at a UN summit in New York  the RPF invaded Rwanda  taking a huge cache of weapons  trucks  boots and uniforms. It was an exodus with biblical overtones: the boys were going home.\n\nKaregeya  working in Ugandan intelligence  was initially left behind as liaison  responsible for connecting commanders in the field with Museveni  but he moved back to Kigali in late 1994 to run external intelligence. “Patrick had built up lots of contacts in the world of intelligence ” Kayumba told me. “He was very knowledgeable  we all thought he was brilliant.”\n\nFor Karegeya and his fellow RPF commanders  this was a frantic  fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants period. The Rwanda they took control of in 1994 had been devastated by the genocide. Putrefying bodies were piled high in churches  schools and stadiums  crops lay untended  buildings had been looted and shrapnel-shredded  the civil service and judiciary were either scattered or dead. Across the country’s borders lurked the late president Habyarimana’s former soldiers and extremist militiamen  plotting to invade.\n\nDuring these years  Rwanda intervened repeatedly in neighbouring Zaire  spearheading a regional alliance that backed rebels who toppled the military dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 (at which point Zaire became the DRC). But Kigali then fell out with Mobutu’s successor  Laurent Kabila  and went on to support a series of rebel movements that operated in the country’s eastern Kivu provinces. All the while  the government Karegeya was part of was quietly helping itself to DRC’s deposits of coltan  diamonds  gold  tungsten and its timber. Rwanda’s new leaders were challenged by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International over human rights abuses  and repeatedly investigated by the UN for their role in the Congo conflict.\n\nTony Blair and Paul Kagame in Kigali in 2011. Photograph: Steve Terill/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfrican diplomats who befriended Karegeya during that era remember a flamboyant  fiercely intelligent personality who served more as de facto foreign minister than intelligence chief. While part of Karegeya’s job was alerting Kagame to potential threats to national security  it also involved coaxing Hutu businessmen to return to Rwanda as investors and persuading the outside world the RPF was a reliable international partner. He was utterly loyal to his boss  Kagame  and very good at what he did.\n\nAt the height of his power  Karegeya would unapologetically and aggressively defend Rwanda’s operations abroad  both military or covert  telling friends the Tutsi community’s very survival was at stake. Just like Israel  he would say  a government that knew from experience that no western power would ever come to its rescue retained the right to intervene well beyond its own borders. But with the passage of time  he began nurturing doubts.\n\nTo outsiders  the RPF seemed a close-knit brotherhood  bound by ties of genuine friendship  business  marriage and blood. Kayumba and Kagame’s wives established and ran a school together  the three couples constantly socialised  their children played with one another  and Kayumba is godfather to one of Kagame’s sons.\n\nBut the harmonious facade was deceptive. As Kagame emerged as the dominant player  unhappiness among former close aides grew. The RPF  paying lip service to ethnic reconciliation  had originally been careful to nominate Pasteur Bizimungu  a Hutu  as president  with Kagame (widely recognised as the real decision-maker) holding the title of defence minister and vice-president. In 2000  Kagame did away with that pretence  wresting the presidency from Bizimungu and arresting him when he set up a political party. Disenchanted former RPF members cite that event as a turning point in their perceptions of Kagame and his ambitions.\n\nAlways free with his opinions  Karegeya made his feelings known about what he saw as the drift towards totalitarianism. When he tried – unsuccessfully – to join his family in the US in 2012  he told the Department of Homeland Security in his application form that he had quarrelled with Kagame over Rwanda’s 1998 invasion of the DRC  the arrests and killings of journalists  the president’s denial of basic citizens’ rights and the consistent manipulation of Rwanda’s media  business and political process.\n\n“It was not just me. Others were also unhappy ” he told a French journalist in the last interview he gave. “Some have paid the price. Others decided to remain silent for ever. It is a matter of choice. If you speak publicly  the consequences are bad. Some are dead  others were imprisoned  others in exile … ” He drew analogies with France’s Louis XIV. “It became clear that at some point  there was no difference between [Kagame] and the State. As you say in France: ‘The State is me.’ And now that he has all the powers  he behaves as an absolute monarch.”\n\nAfter he was sacked by Kagame  Karegeya shuttled in and out of detention. He was jailed without charge  then kept under house arrest  then finally tried and sentenced to 18 months for insubordination. On his release in November 2007  he was privately warned by a friend in the military that he would die if he remained in Kigali. So he fled.\n\nHigh-profile Rwandans who decide to leave the country have developed a strategy. First  persuade a friend to drive you to the Ugandan border. Then  before you are in sight of the customs post  stop the car and get out. While your friend drives across the frontier and undergoes the necessary security checks  you swim across the river  and reunite with the car at an agreed spot on the other side.\n\nThree years later  Karegeya was joined in South Africa by Kayumba  the former army chief  who was hugely popular with the troops. Kayumba had been sent to India as ambassador – the kind of posting twitchy presidents use to marginalise potential challengers – but made the mistake of returning to Rwanda to bury his mother. His military colleagues summoned him for a dressing-down  demanding he write Kagame an apology for a list of perceived infractions. Instead  Kayumba drove through the night to the border.\n\nTogether with two other Rwandan exiles – Gerard Gahima  the former prosecutor general  and Theogene Rudasingwa  once the RPF’s general secretary – the two men set up the RNC  and joined a coalition of Hutu and Tutsi opposition parties that hoped to mount a challenge to Kagame. The RNC’s combination of intelligence contacts  popularity with the troops and diplomatic and legal knowhow rattled the president. Officials in Kigali routinely describe its members as “terrorists”. The government in Kigali has in the past accused the RNC of merging forces with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda  a DRC-based group made up of former soldiers and members of the Hutu Interahamwe militia – an allegation calculated to shock still-traumatised members of the Tutsi elite  who blame those men for the 1994 slaughter of their families and friends. More recently  Kigali seized on claims in a report drafted by a UN Group of Experts alleging that a militia taking orders from Kayumba is being trained on a plateau in eastern DRC  a claim the RNC adamantly denies.\n\nFew countries divide world opinion more dramatically than Rwanda. Where some see a miracle of rebirth  others see an oppressive surveillance state  a Potemkin village destined for eventual collapse. Articles by foreign journalists visiting Rwanda often seem to follow the same formula: they marvel at the pristine state of the roads  the absence of rubbish – Rwanda was the first African country to ban plastic bags – and the gleaming corrugated iron roofs (rather than messy thatch)  and then ooh and aah at Kigali’s soaring skyline  its new conference centre  its investment in ICT  its streamlined bureaucracy and its embryonic welfare scheme. The fact that women account for half of Rwanda’s cabinet and 61% of its parliamentary seats gets an approving mention  along with statistics – on poverty alleviation  primary school attendance  maternal mortality  bovine vaccination and mosquito net distribution – that make hearts beat faster at the British Department for International Development  USAid  Oxfam and Unicef.\n\nBusiness journalists  usually harder to please  rave about the economy. In a feature headlined “The Emerging Economy to Watch”  Forbes magazine last month described Rwanda as a “role model for the continent”. It singled out for special mention Rwanda’s ranking by Transparency International as Africa’s third-least corrupt country  and its No 2 ranking on the continent by the World Bank on an Ease of Doing Business index.\n\nThese achievements are usually presented by the Rwandan media as Kagame’s personal handiwork  a view embraced by visitors. Andrew Mitchell  Britain’s former international development secretary  lists Kagame alongside Margaret Thatcher as one of the two greatest leaders he has met. “It’s a very self-confident regime which has achieved miracles in the last 25 years ” he told me.\n\nRwandan newspapers  radio stations and news sites broadcast a steady stream of the president’s speeches and public appearances  in one long paean of praise. In certain quarters  the reed-thin  soberly suited president enjoys the kind of uncritical adulation abroad once lavished on Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi. A Wikipedia page dedicated to Kagame’s honorary degrees and awards from western institutions runs to 26 entries. Tony and Cherie Blair  Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clintons – all of whose foundations are heavily invested in Rwanda – are unabashed admirers. When the US philanthropist Howard Buffett appeared alongside Kagame at a 2016 conference he announced that continued investment in Rwanda was conditional on the president remaining at the helm.\n\nRwanda also punches above its weight diplomatically. Kagame’s one-year chairmanship of the African Union  which ends this month  galvanised the continent  as he launched plans for a continent-wide free trade area and lectured member nations on ending dependence on western funding. The president’s readiness to contribute troops to international peacekeeping operations goes down particularly well in Washington  which is determined to keep US soldiers on the ground in Africa to a minimum. Rwandan peacekeepers  known for their effectiveness in the field  are currently deployed in South Sudan and Central African Republic. Having invited the World Economic Forum to stage an African Davos in Kigali in 2016  he also persuaded the Commonwealth to hold its Heads of Government meeting there in 2020.\n\nRwandan soldiers serving as as UN peacekeepers in 2005. Photograph: Ricky Gare/EPA\n\nThese achievements are a tribute to what sustained determination and drive can achieve. But admiration takes a knock as soon as one starts examining Rwanda’s record on human rights and political freedom.\n\nThe post-genocide constitution drawn up in 2003 originally limited Kagame to two terms in office  but an amendment approved by 98% of voters in 2015 made it theoretically possible for him to stay in office until 2034. At the same time  Kagame has joined a number of African leaders who are careful to prepare no successors and to avoid establishing institutions that might one day hold them to account. Rwandan elections  in which Kagame routinely wins over 90% of the vote  are barely credible affairs and many of the organisations that routinely monitor polls in Africa quietly give them a miss.\n\nGiven Rwanda’s enthusiasm for advertising gender equality in its political leadership  it is ironic that two women who attempted to challenge Kagame in the 2017 presidential elections – which Kagame won with 98.8% of the vote – were both prevented from running. Diane Rwigara  a young Tutsi  was disqualified and later jailed for inciting insurrection and forgery. Victoire Ingabire  Rwanda’s most high-profile Hutu politician  was already in prison for genocide denial. In response to sustained US pressure  both women were released  but too late for them to compete.\n\nKigali is a city of tended flowerbeds and painted road verges  where it is safe for a young woman to walk home at night – not something to be taken lightly on streets where militiamen once macheted families to death at checkpoints. But is it also  according to human rights groups and Kagame’s critics  a land of sudden disappearances  mysterious car accidents  arbitrary military detention  torture and constant surveillance – where even distant relatives or mere associates of those who have earned the regime’s disapproval are considered guilty by association.\n\n“Rwanda has done a terrific job of hiding many of these abuses behind the curtain of economic and social recovery ” Kate Barth  of the human rights organisation Freedom Now told a US congressional hearing in November. “The Rwandan government knows that its abuses won’t remain hidden for much longer ” she added. “It’s time for Rwanda to allow peaceful dissent.” Human rights groups report that intimidation at home has been matched by a brazen campaign to silence Rwandan dissidents abroad – with lack of respect for international borders redolent of Putin. A 2014 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report detailed 13 cases of former RPF politicians  military figures  intelligence agents and journalists who had fled Rwanda and been assassinated  kidnapped or attacked in Kenya  Uganda  South Africa or the UK.\n\n“As critics or opponents of the government  the victims all share a certain profile ” the report read. “Prior to these attacks many had been threatened by individuals who were part of  or close to  the Rwandan government.” Despite government officials’ tendency to present Rwanda’s story in terms of a beleaguered Tutsi minority fighting for survival in a Hutu-dominated society  most of those targeted have been both former RPF insiders and Tutsis.\n\nThe Hutu politician Seth Sendashonga was shot in his car in Nairobi in 1998  the journalist Charles Ingabire was murdered in Kampala in 2011 and the former presidential bodyguard Joel Mutabazi was kidnapped in Kampala in 2013 and taken to Rwanda  where he was tortured and is now serving a life sentence. The HRW report emphasised that these were only the most high-profile and best documented cases. “For every one of them ” said Carina Tertsakian  who worked on the report  “there are tens and scores of small people  non-celebrities inside Rwanda  who disappear  or are arrested and held without charge  or murdered  and no one ever talks about them.”\n\nThe Rwandan government has always indignantly denied responsibility for these things. But it is not just Rwandan exiles in South Africa who have been threatened – police forces in the US  the UK and Belgium have all given warnings to resident Rwandan dissidents that their lives may be in danger. Canada’s border agency has described a “well-documented pattern of repression of Rwanda critics”  while Sweden felt obliged to place an exiled Rwandan journalist under police guard  and expelled a Rwandan diplomat for spying on Rwandan refugees.\n\nThree months after the murder of Karegeya  another attempt was made on Kayumba’s life: this time his safe house in Johannesburg was attacked by an armed gang. In response  an exasperated South African government expelled three Rwandan diplomats. Later in 2014  a South African judge delivered guilty verdicts to four of the six men tried for the attempted murder of Kayumba during the 2010 World Cup – and labelled the shooting “politically motivated”. While carefully avoiding mentioning Kagame or any Rwandan official by name  the judge commented that ordinary South Africans were “sick and tired of the ongoing and senseless killings of foreign nationals based on political reasons”.\n\nHis words hit home. “That case was tremendously important because this was the first time Rwanda was caught red-handed. It showed the world what the Rwandan government is all about ” said David Himbara from exile in Canada. “Rwandan violence ended up in a court of law.”\n\nEven foreign critics of Rwanda’s human rights record have been targeted. The Canadian journalist Judi Rever spent years researching atrocities committed by the RPF for her book In Praise of Blood  which was published in 2018. While she was doing her research  she flew to Brussels – where  to her surprise  the Belgian police  acting on intelligence  assigned her a team of armed bodyguards and an armoured car. She was told: “We have reason to believe that the Rwandan embassy in Brussels constitutes a threat to your security.”\n\nThe inquest in Randburg  which will include testimony from Karegeya’s nephew  David Batenga  and his widow  Leah Karegeya  may represent a reckoning for Rwanda’s international reputation. It threatens to become a reality check for the western governments  development agencies and philanthropic foundations that have backed Kagame while turning a blind eye to a mounting mass of worrying indications of human rights abuses. It offers a chance to re-examine an aid paradigm that increasingly privileges order and stability over democratic freedoms.\n\nRwandan officials profess to be unconcerned. “There is nothing new about these allegations ” Rwanda’s high commissioner to South Africa  Vincent Karega  said in an email replying to questions about the case. “They have been recycled many times in [the] media  year in  year out. Rwanda has nothing to do with the death of Patrick Karegeya.” He added that Karegeya and Kayumba had been convicted of terrorism in Rwanda and should be brought to justice: “Whichever way  Rwanda is confident to deal with any threat to the country and its leadership integrity against any detractors’ actions.”\n\nThat’s not the way Kagame’s critics see it. When I interviewed General Kayumba last November  the realities of life under a de facto death sentence from Rwanda were apparent. I was driven to the meeting  whose venue I was not told in advance  by a South African bodyguard whose loose cotton shirt barely concealed a gun. I was eventually shown to a dark corner of an anonymous steakhouse off a busy freeway. When he appeared out of the darkness  the general looked in surprisingly good shape for someone who still has a bullet fragment from the 2010 assassination attempt lodged near his spine.\n\nWe sat with our backs to a brick wall  under the watchful eyes of his security detail. The continuing risk to the general and his fellow dissidents was recently highlighted by the case of Alex Ruta  a Rwandan intelligence officer seeking asylum in South Africa  who has testified in court that he was sent to Johannesburg in 2014 with orders to eliminate prominent members of the RNC.\n\n“We have a moral obligation not to let this opportunity slip by ” Kayumba said of the inquest. “When Kagame kills in his own country  he gets away with it  there’s silence. If we cannot even have a voice in the place we have run away to  then what is the point of running? We should have just stayed in Kigali and supported the regime.”\n\nFor the general  giving evidence at the inquest represents a duty to a friend whose posthumous maligning by former friends and colleagues still cuts to the quick: “We must ensure that justice is delivered to Patrick  who did not deserve to die in this way.”\n\nBut the inquest’s outcome could reverberate far beyond South Africa. The principles of international development  insiders say  have changed since the idealistic era that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall  when the industrialised north felt the reconstruction of war-traumatised nations was within its gift  and dreamed of strong civil societies that would spread western values across Africa. In the era of Trump and rising European nativism  the focus has shifted toward backing “reliable” partners in the developing world who promise stability  law and order  and support in the fight against Islamist terrorism.\n\n“There’s been a palpable shift. We’ve gone from the new world order  with its commitment to entrenching human rights and democracy  back to a new version of the cold war ” said Phil Vernon  a veteran British development consultant. “One thing you always hear about Kagame is: ‘He gets stuff done.’ There’s that phrase attributed to Franklin Roosevelt [about Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza García]: ‘He may be a son of a bitch  but he’s our son of a bitch.’”\n\nAndrew Mitchell  the former international development secretary  has no time for what he sees as criticisms delivered from “the luxury of 800 years of democracy”  saying: “There a tendency for Rwanda to be judged through the eyes of sophisticated western soi-disant liberals  and that’s the wrong way to view it.” The key question  he said  is: “What is the direction of travel – are they getting better or worse? Alongside extraordinary development progress  there has been  and is  movement in the right direction. This is a very tough  very good regime which makes up its mind on the basis of its own self-confidence.”\n\nOpinion in the international community has splintered in tandem with Kagame’s former inner circle. Many feel that the time when concerns about human rights  or the military’s stifling presence in Rwandan society  would be best raised discreetly behind closed doors has passed. “We need to ask ourselves whether we’re going down the right route  as allies of Rwanda ” Vernon said. “Or whether we should be playing the role of sceptical friend  telling an ally when it’s done something which  in our eyes  is completely wrong – and saying so publicly.”'],five star hotel disturb sign exerts strange kind magic privacy rich man prerequisite staff train never enter room sign dangle door handle

Rwanda forces kill soldier on DR Congo border,https://news.yahoo.com/rwanda-forces-kill-soldier-dr-143250259.html,"['A man wearing a Congolese military uniform was killed by Rwandan troops early Saturday after he crossed the volatile border and started firing at local forces  the Rwandan military said.\n\nThe incident occurred at about 1 am (2300 GMT Friday)  the Rwanda Defence Force said  amid heightened tensions between Kigali and Kinshasa over the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe RDF said on Twitter that ""an unidentified soldier believed to be from the FARDC (DR Congo armed forces)"" crossed the border ""and started shooting at Rwanda Defence Force guard towers"".\n\n""He was shot dead by RDF patrol before causing any casualties "" it added.\n\nThe shooting took place on the Rwandan side of the so-called ""Petite Barriere"" border post  one of two linking the main eastern DRC city of Goma and Gisenyi in Rwanda.\n\nRelations between the two neighbours are strained over Kinshasa\'s charges that Kigali backs the M23 rebel group  which has been capturing swathes of territory in the eastern DRC in fighting that has sent thousands of people fleeing.\n\nThe border area was calm on Saturday after the shooting incident and people were continuing to go about their daily lives.\n\nAFP journalists saw a team from the Expanded Joint Verification Mechanism  a body which monitors the Great Lakes area and investigates security incidents  in no-man\'s land between Rwanda and DRC.\n\nCongolese officials said the identity of the dead man was not known  but that no Congolese soldier on duty in the area had been reported missing.\n\n""There was a lot of gunfire during the night "" said one local resident  Grace Mbala. ""We were scared  we thought it was the M23 coming back.""\n\nOn Friday  Kenya\'s former president Uhuru Kenyatta -- who is mediating in the conflict -- said Rwandan President Paul Kagame had agreed to help push for the M23 to cease fire and withdraw from captured territory.\n\nThe main frontline lies about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Goma  while fighting is also under way near the Ugandan border and in Masisi to the west of the city.\n\nburs-txw/cdw']",man wear congolese military uniform kill rwandan troop early saturday cross volatile border start fire local force rwandan military say n nthe incident occur gmt friday rwanda defence force say amid heighten tension kigali kinshasa conflict east democratic republic congo n nthe rdf say twitter unidentified soldier believe fardc dr congo arm force cross border start shoot rwanda defence force guard tower n n shot dead rdf patrol cause casualty add n nthe shoot take place rwandan side call petite barriere border post one two link main eastern drc city goma gisenyi rwanda n nrelations two neighbour strain kinshasa charge kigali back rebel group capture swathe territory eastern drc fight send thousand people flee n nthe border area calm saturday shoot incident people continue go daily life n nafp journalist saw team expand joint verification mechanism body monitor great lake area investigate security incident man land rwanda drc n ncongolese official say identity dead man know congolese soldier duty area report miss n n lot gunfire night say one local resident grace mbala scar think come back n non friday kenya former president uhuru kenyatta mediate conflict say rwandan president paul kagame agree help push cease fire withdraw capture territory n nthe main frontline lie kilometres mile goma fight also way near ugandan border masisi west city n nburs txw cdw,0.6114200591783722,1
"1 million killed by machete, club and gun: Rwanda remembers its ...",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/one-million-killed-by-machete-club-and-gun-rwanda-remembers-its-genocide-20-years-later/,"['KIGALI  Rwanda - Sorrowful wails and uncontrollable sobs resounded Monday as thousands of Rwandans packed the country\'s main sports stadium to mark the 20th anniversary of the beginning of a devastating 100-day genocide.\n\nPresident Paul Kagame and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon together lit a flame at the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre  which estimates that 1 000 050 Rwandan perished in three months of machete and gunfire attacks mostly aimed at the country\'s minority Tutsi population by extremist Hutus.\n\n""Twenty years ago today our country fell into deep ditches of darkness "" said Rwanda\'s minister of foreign affairs  Louise Mushikiwabo. ""Twenty years later  today  we are a country united and a nation elevated.""\n\nIn the aftermath of the genocide  Rwandans felt alone  she said. But now friends around the world have joined ""to commemorate the rebirth of our nation "" she said.\n\nRepresentatives from France  however  were absent after a spat with Kagame that began with him accusing the country of participating in the execution of parts of the genocide violence. In an apparent jab at Paris  Mushikiwabo welcomed French citizens to Monday\'s stadium ceremony.\n\nEver since the massive killing spree  the world community has been forced to acknowledge that it stood by and did nothing. The U.N. chief told a news conference he hopes to reaffirm the international community\'s commitment to the idea of ""never again "" though he said there are genocide symptoms elsewhere. Many experts say neighboring Central African Republic is at risk  Syria as well.\n\nThe skulls and bones of some of those who were slaughtered as they sought refuge inside a church are laid out as a memorial to the thousands who were killed in and around the Catholic church during the 1994 genocide in Ntarama  Rwanda  Friday  April 4  2014. AP Photo/Ben Curtis\n\nThe-President Bill Clinton has said he regrets not doing more to prevent the slaughter in Rwanda and that ""it had an enduring impact on me.""\n\nIn a speech Clinton gave during a visit to Kigali in 1998  he said: ""The international community  together with nations in Africa  must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy  as well. We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear  and full of hope.""\n\nMany have blamed U.S. reluctance to act in Rwanda on the infamous ""Black Hawk Down"" incident in Somalia just a year earlier  which made the American public and therefore its politicians reluctant to involve itself in another African conflict.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations  Samantha Power  who attended Monday\'s ceremony  said the genocide was a ""devastating reminder that nightmares seemingly beyond imagination can in fact take place.""\n\nAs a survivor recounted his tale of violence  it triggered emotional reactions that required some mourners to be assisted by psychological counselors who were on standby. Bloodcurdling screams recalling the horror of seeing whole families slaughtered rang out from the crowd.\n\nThe violence Rwanda saw is nearly unimaginable. Hutu attackers burned down churches with hundreds or thousands of Tutsis inside. Machete-wielding attackers entered homes and slaughtered children and grandparents. Mr. Clinton  in his 1998 speech  said: ""Scholars of these sorts of events say that the killers  armed mostly with machetes and clubs  nonetheless did their work five times as fast as the mechanized gas chambers used by the Nazis.""\n\nIn Rwanda  a green and hilly and tranquil looking land  genocide survivor Immaculee Illibagiza told ""60 Minutes"" in a 2006 interview she saw something in the distance in 1994 and realized life would never be the same.\n\n""I remember looking up to the hill across the river. And I saw somebody actually with a machete cutting somebody. And we were all like  \'Wow! Something\'s happening here. They\'re going to kill us \'"" she remembers. ""A person like when they\'re cutting  cutting. And somebody was screaming.""\n\nPeople were screaming all over the country. The genocide had begun. It was extremely low tech - no gas chambers here - just machetes  spears and knives  wielded by Hutus  the majority tribe as they tried to wipe out the minority Tutsis.\n\nHundreds of mass graves were dug across the country to bury the victims of what the government says was a long-planned killing spree that ignited after the plane of then-President Juvenal Habyarimana  a Hutu  was shot down.\n\nNow-President Kagame led a Tutsi military force from neighboring Uganda into Rwanda to end the mass murders.\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame addresses the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of his country\'s genocide at Amahoro Stadium April 7  2014  in Kigali  Rwanda. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nKagame has won praise for pulling his country out of the worst spasm of violence the world has seen in decades. His government has advanced women\'s rights  economic development and health care. But critics say that progress has been marred by the government\'s authoritarian grip on control that has seen many government critics and opposition members killed. Many Rwanda watchers have begun to call his 14-year reign a dictatorship.\n\nHuman Rights Watch  which Kigali practically views as an enemy organization  says civil and political rights in the country remain severely curtailed. It said the persistence of attacks on Rwandan government critics in exile ""is striking.""\n\nAs the anniversary approached  visitors began flooding the Kigali Genocide Memorial.\n\n""After the genocide Rwanda was really a destroyed country  destroyed society. There was this feeling of being hopeless to people "" said the memorial\'s manager Honore Gatera  mentioning all the orphans the genocide created  and all the citizens with physical and psychological wounds.\n\nHowever  he argued: ""Rwandans got to know the dangers of humanity  meaning  in a positive way  now Rwanda knows how to educate ourselves  our children  our neighbors and our friends "" he said.\n\nEven as the three-month period of mourning began  a diplomatic spat between Rwanda and France escalated. Kagame in an interview with Jeune Afrique published Monday condemned France and Belgium for their actions surrounding the genocide  accusing both of having done too little to save lives. He also accused France of participating in the execution of parts of the genocide violence.\n\nIn response to the accusations  the Paris government said France\'s justice minister would not come to Kigali as planned. France\'s ambassador to Rwanda says he was then barred from the remembrance ceremonies.']",kigali rwanda sorrowful wail uncontrollable sob resound monday thousand rwandan pack country main sport stadium mark th anniversary begin devastate day genocide n npresident paul kagame u n secretary general ban ki moon together light flame kigali genocide memorial centre estimate rwandan perish three month machete gunfire attack mostly aim country minority tutsi population extremist hutu n n twenty year ago today country fell deep ditch darkness say rwanda minister foreign affair louise mushikiwabo twenty year later today country unite nation elevate n nin aftermath genocide rwandan felt alone say friend around world join commemorate rebirth nation say n nrepresentatives france however absent spat kagame begin accuse country participate execution part genocide violence apparent jab paris mushikiwabo welcome french citizen monday stadium ceremony n never since massive kill spree world community force acknowledge stood nothing u n chief tell news conference hop reaffirm international community commitment idea never though say genocide symptom elsewhere many expert say neighboring central african republic risk syria well n nthe skull bone slaughter sought refuge inside church lay memorial thousand kill around catholic church genocide ntarama rwanda friday april ap photo ben curtis n nthe president bill clinton say regret prevent slaughter rwanda endure impact n nin speech clinton give visit kigali say international community together nation africa must bear share responsibility tragedy well act quickly enough kill begin allow refugee camp become safe killer immediately call crime rightful name genocide can not change past must everything power help build future without fear full hope n nmany blame u reluctance act rwanda infamous black hawk incident somalia year earlier make american public therefore politician reluctant involve another african conflict n nthe u ambassador united nation samantha power attend monday ceremony say genocide devastate reminder nightmare seemingly beyond imagination fact take place n nas survivor recount tale violence trigger emotional reaction require mourner assist psychological counselor standby bloodcurdling scream recall horror see whole family slaughter rang crowd n nthe violence rwanda saw nearly unimaginable hutu attacker burn church hundred thousand tutsi inside machete wield attacker enter home slaughtered child grandparent mr clinton speech say scholar sort event say killer arm mostly machetes club nonetheless work five time fast mechanize gas chamber use nazis n nin rwanda green hilly tranquil look land genocide survivor immaculee illibagiza tell minute interview saw something distance realize life would never n n remember look hill across river saw somebody actually machete cut somebody like wow something happen go kill u remembers person like cut cut somebody scream n npeople scream country genocide begin extremely low tech gas chamber machetes spear knife wield hutus majority tribe try wipe minority tutsi n nhundreds mass graf dug across country bury victim government say long plan kill spree ignite plane president juvenal habyarimana hutu shot n nnow president kagame lead tutsi military force neighbor uganda rwanda end mass murder n nrwandan president paul kagame address commemoration th anniversary country genocide amahoro stadium april kigali rwanda chip somodevilla getty image n nkagame praise pull country bad spasm violence world see decades government advance woman right economic development health care critic say progress marred government authoritarian grip control see many government critic opposition member kill many rwanda watcher begin call year reign dictatorship n nhuman right watch kigali practically view enemy organization say civil political right country remain severely curtail say persistence attack rwandan government critic exile strike n nas anniversary approach visitor begin flood kigali genocide memorial n n genocide rwanda really destroyed country destroy society feeling hopeless people say memorial manager honore gatera mention orphan genocide create citizen physical psychological wound n nhowever argue rwandan get know danger humanity mean positive way rwanda know educate child neighbor friend say n neven three month period mourn begin diplomatic spat rwanda france escalate kagame interview jeune afrique publish monday condemn france belgium action surround genocide accuse do little save life also accuse france participate execution part genocide violence n nin response accusation paris government say france justice minister would come kigali plan france ambassador rwanda say bar remembrance ceremony,0.6346755366992839,1
"Rwanda 1994: ...kill as many people as you want, you cannot kill their ...",https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/misc/5xfncq.htm,"['Speech by Philippe Gaillard  head of the ICRC\'s delegation in Rwanda  1993-1994; given at the Genocide Prevention Conference  London  January 2002  organized by the Aegis Trust and the UK Foreign Office\n\n""Die Sprache spricht als das Geläute der Stille""\n\n(Martin Heidegger  Unterwegs zur Sprache)\n\n© L\'ILLUSTRÉ /Claude Glunz/ref. rw-d-00020-16\n\nKigali. Unaccompanied children in the care of the ICRC\n\nIn 1994  before  during and after the genocide during which around one million people were killed  most of them civilians  I gave hundreds of interviews  reports  conferences to all kind of audiences  newspapers  TV  radios and the general public. And afterwards I think this was not only the right action to take but also the right therapy.At the end of 1994  I decided not to talk any more about the Rwandan genocide and declined all the invitations I was receiving about it. I just wanted to go back to silence and to invisibility as it suits an ICRC delegate and because of my rather shy and discreet personality.\n\nAlmost 8 years have gone since the genocide was committed and by being here I am once again talking about it. Not because I am less shy today than 8 years ago  not because I need to be visible again - I wish I were never visible again - but because I still have some kind of debt  or better to say  some kind of duty towards all those who died in Rwanda in 1994 and who were given so little attention later on that some of us think that the Rwandan genocide can be considered as a "" case study "" .\n\nFor those who died and especially for those who survived  it is certainly not and it will never be a "" case study "" .\n\nIt is because of them that I am here today. You may kill as many people as you want or as you can. You cannot kill their memory. The memory is the most invisible and resistant material you can find on the earth. You cannot cut it like diamond  you cannot shoot at it because you cannot see it  nevertheless it is everywhere  all around you  plenty of silence  unsaid suffering  whispers  absent looks. Sometimes you can smell it and then the memory clearly speaks like the whisper of silence. Sometimes the smell is still unbearable  even when things have been forgotten for decades.\n\nPrevention  neutrality and reporting\n\nIn July 1993  two weeks before the Arusha peace agreement was signed by President Habyarimana and Alexis Kanyarengwe  we met President Habyarimana. When we talked about the danger of anti-personnel mines on the front line  President Habyarimana told us he was fu lly aware of it  but added: "" The main danger is actually that the hearts and minds of the Rwandan people are mined "" . This was a "" preventive "" message.\n\nOne month later  after the Arusha peace agreement had been signed  I met the President of the MRND  the governmental party  Matthieu Ngirumpatse  and asked his opinion about the very recent peace agreement. He told me the following: "" Sir  don\'t believe too much in it… In Africa peace agreements are too often just scraps of paper"" . Just another message of "" prevention "" .\n\nA couple of weeks later  around 50 civilians were killed in the demilitarised zone monitored by the UN troops led by General Romeo Dallaire. Immediately a very aggressive campaign was launched against General Dallaire by the Radio- Television Libre des Mille Collines accusing him in a very cynical way not to be able to identify and punish the responsible people for the killings. Another message of "" prevention "" by provoking people against the UN peacekeeping forces.\n\nIn January 1994  the situation in Kigali was very tense. So it was in February when one Minister  Félicien Katawasi  and the President of the extremist party CDR  Martin Bouchiana  were killed.\n\nSporadic fighting in the north\n\nThen the dialogue between the Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) stopped. Sporadic fighting took place in the northern part of the country.\n\nJust before Easter  the Dean of the diplomatic corps convoked me. He advised me to be on the alert for something bad could happen very soon. Prevention. I asked all my people not to leave the town.\n\nAs Christoph Plate says: ""It is not until war breaks out or famine is rife or there is a massacre that people begin to wonder what caused it. The period prior to the disaster then becomes a news item or a background story. Reports in the media can indeed influence conflicts  but they can hardly ever prevent them"" (Journalists\'reports cannot prevent conflict in International Review of the Red Cross  No 839  p. 617-624  30 September 2000).\n\nThe Rwandan genocide was so well covered by the media  especially by the western media  that everyone could follow it on TV  radio or in newspapers every day. One could say that it was transmitted live  at least live enough to inform the governments and public about what was really happening there.\n\nICRC speaks of ""systematic carnage""\n\nThe ICRC contributed to this media coverage and reporting like it maybe never had done in its almost 130 years of existence at that time. On 28 April 1994  some three weeks after the beginning of the genocide  the ICRC called on the governments concerned including all members of the Security Council to take all possible measures to put an end to the massacres. The words used - ""systematic carnage""   ""the extermination of a significant portion of the civilian population"" - left no room for doubt about what was going on.\n\n""After half a million  sir  we stopped counting...""\n\nAt the same time  BBC London called us in Kigali and asked us what our estimate of the number of people killed was. We said at least 250 00 0. One week later they called again. We said at least 500 000. And once again the following week. And then we said: ""After half a million  sir  we stopped counting"" . We were never asked the same question again.\n\nAt the beginning of May  I was invited by General Romeo Dallaire to meet with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  Ambassador José Ayala Lasso. When we came to figures  I was told I was exaggerating.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to General Dallaire\'s courage  actions and always helpful pieces of advice. He saved many lives  among them that of our medical coordinator who had been hit by shrapnel of a rocket launched by the RPF on an ICRC convoy on its way from Kigali to Gitarama on 19 May.\n\nMassacred in a Red Cross ambulance\n\nPrevention: zero. Reporting: ineffective. Maybe with one exception: on 14 April  in the presence of the Rwandan armed forces  militiamen killed six wounded civilians who were on their way to our hospital in a Red Cross ambulance. The Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines announced that the Red Cross was transporting "" enemies of the Republic disguised as fake wounded"" .\n\nExplanations  protests  at our request the ICRC headquarters issued a strong press release which was immediately broadcast everywhere by the BBC and Radio France Internationale  among others  boomerang effect on the field  new explanations  the Rwandan Government and media became aware of the considerable deterioration of their image  corrections  awareness campaign on the right of the wounded to be taken care of and on the role of the Red Cross… S ome kind of test: we could have been killed for that statement but we were not and the Red Cross ambulances could restart their work without problems.\n\nThe killing of six wounded people allowed us to save thousands of others  9 000 altogether between April and July according to the statistics of our makeshift hospital. Speaking out is always dangerous in such situations  exceptionally it may be effective.\n\n""How can you be neutral in front of genocide?""\n\nNeutrality: THE key point. Many of you will ask: how can you be neutral in front of genocide? Of course you cannot be neutral in front of genocide. But the genocide is happening in front of your eyes every day. It is a fact. As a Red Cross worker  you really don\'t have the political - not to mention the military - means to stop it. All you can try to do is to save what can be saved  leftovers  wounded  and when I say wounded  maybe I am wrong  I should say people not finished off by machetes or screwdrivers. And it was really the case during the first weeks when we were evacuating wounded people - all of them Tutsis - to our hospital.\n\nAnd that is when problems start. Humanitarian neutrality means first to be on the side of the victims  of ALL the victims. But when the victims belong to the same category  then their executioners start to look at you with suspicion. This must have been the reason why  after having given a very difficult interview to the Rwandan National Radio  the Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines started to broadcast that I was without doubt a Belgian national  which was simply a death sentence.\n\nI was talking with the government authorities in Gitarama when I was informed about that. I immediately asked them to call the Radio-Television libre des Mille Collines and to ask it to correct its declaration. They did it in a very efficient - although not very elegant - way  by broadcasting that I ""was too courageous and too clever to be a Belgian national"" .\n\nMixed population at the hospital\n\nA couple of days later  the Radio-Television libre des Mille Collines was targeted by the RPF. One of their most famous announcers  Noël  was badly injured in one of his feet and was brought to our hospital… I felt on the safe side: our hospital just started to have a mixed population and this trend increased continuously in the following weeks when wounded militiamen and members of the armed forces had no other place to go to be taken care of but our poor makeshift hospital  which became some kind of a sacred place  a strong symbol and demonstration of neutrality.\n\nIn mid-April  the new Prime Minister  Jean Kambanda  asked us to evacuate the dead bodies from the streets of Kigali. I refused  asking to stop the killings first. Then the authorities decided to use the common law prisoners to evacuate the bodies  but they had no fuel for the trucks. We gave them the fuel. I learned a couple of days later that they evacuated 67 000 bodies from the streets of Kigali  a town with 200 000 inhabitants before 6 April.\n\nLater on  because of the lack of chlorine and aluminium sulfate  Kigali was left without water. We provided the necessary products and could thus postpone the death throes of the central pumping station. And so on. These humanitarian gestures were duly appreciated.\n\nOne millimetre of humanity\n\nThis might explain why - at our request - the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare  Jean de Dieu Habimeza  went personally to an orphanage close to Gisenyi and  with the full support of the Rwandan armed forces  saved 300 children of a certain slaughter by the militiamen; it could also explain why 35 000 people could survive in Kabgayi  another 8 000 in Nyarushishi camp  the only survivors of the prefecture of Cyangugu; why another 600 orphans in Butare. And so on. Maybe 70 000 people all together  just one millimetre of humanity out of kilometres of horrors and unspeakable suffering.\n\nThe most incredible event I personally witnessed happened at the very beginning of July  just before the RPF took over Kigali: six heavily-armed militiamen came to our hospital. They were drunk  but surprisingly not aggressive at all; they had one prisoner  a young Tutsi lady; they told me: ""This woman has been with us for the past three months  she is a nurse  we are about to leave the town  we have decided not to kill her despite the fact that she is a Tutsi  as a nurse she will be more useful in your hospital than dead…""\n\nI never received a better acknowledgment of the efficiency of neutrality.\n\nWar is destruction  negation of life. Humanitarian action works within this subtraction. It tries to reduce it. In case of a genocide  it may seem a stupid gamble  since it\'s well-known that genocidal logic is the complete negation of the humanitarian spirit and of the law.\n\nWhenever you can reduce this negation it is a miracle. And the memory never forgets miracles.']",speech philippe gaillard head icrc delegation rwanda give genocide prevention conference london january organize aegis trust uk foreign office n n die sprache

Rwanda asylum seekers will use people smugglers for deadly trip back to ...,https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/rwanda-asylum-seekers-will-use-people-smugglers-for-deadly-trip-back-to-uk-says-country-s-opposition-leader/ar-AAYsnyO,['Asylum seekers sent from the UK to Rwanda will flee the African country and risk death by using people-smuggling gangs to reach Europe again  the country’s opposition leader has said.\n\nVictoire Ingabire Umuhoza branded the Government of Rwanda a “dictatorial regime” which “doesn’t care” about asylum seekers being sent from Britain.\n\nShe accused the UK Government of breaching the UN’s 1951 Refugee Convention over its Rwanda policy and said she was “surprised” to learn about the Home Office scheme  which is costing UK taxpayers £120 million over five years.\n\n“The Government of Rwanda knows that these refugees will not stay in Rwanda ” Ms Ingabire told i. “This is why they accepted this deal.”\n\nMs Ingabire  53  a leading critic of President Paul Kagame  spent eight years in prison after being convicted in 2010 of genocide denial following her return to Rwanda from exile to take part in presidential elections.\n\n“This is a dictatorial regime ” she said. “All the power is in the hands of President Kagame. The justice  the judges are not free  we have a parliament that can’t do anything or make any decisions.”\n\nWhen asked about the threat of asylum seekers turning to people smugglers to leave Rwanda after they are deported there  Ms Ingabire pointed to the estimated 4 000 asylum seekers deported from Israel to Rwanda and Uganda under a secret deal from 2014 to 2017 as proof that most who arrive from the UK will also leave.\n\nThe majority escaped almost immediately  with many attempting to return to Europe via people-smuggling routes.\n\n“Where are the refugees that Israel sent to Rwanda? They are no longer in Rwanda ” she said. “They left and went back in Europe.\n\n“That will happen again with these refugees that the UK will send to Rwanda. They will not be in prison – they have a right to go where they want.\n\n“That means they will not stay in Rwanda and the Government of Rwanda knows that.”\n\nIn 2018  an Oxford University study found that Eritrean and Sudanese migrants sent by Israel to Rwanda and Uganda made a “dangerous journey” through South Sudan  Sudan and Libya en route to Europe.\n\nDuring the journey  they were subjected to human trafficking  incarceration  the threat of forcible deportation to Eritrea  harsh conditions of starvation  violence and slavery in torture camps in Libya.\n\nAfter that  they then faced a dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Europe.\n\nMs Ingabire  a member of the Hutu ethnic group  was handed a 15-year jail sentence after questioning why Rwanda’s official memorial to the 1994 genocide did not include any Hutus.\n\nFive of her eight years in jail were spent in solitary confinement before her release under a presidential pardon in 2018. She is unable to leave the country  with the Government barring her from visiting her husband and children in the Netherlands.\n\nThe leader of the opposition Dalfa-Umurinzi party believes her conviction was politically motivated.\n\n“Everybody knows Rwanda is known to be a country where democracy and human rights are not respected ” she said.\n\n“The British government know it  they know Rwanda’s government does not respect human rights and they decided to send refugees to a country like Rwanda.\n\n“The Geneva Convention says you can’t send refugees to a country when you know their liberty could be in danger.”\n\nShe said that four members of the opposition have been killed and four disappeared in recent years  with the Rwandan government unable to provide answers.\n\n“In two years  four members from the political party have disappeared and four others were killed ” she said.\n\n“Until today  the Rwanda government cannot explain who killed these people. The problem is only members of the opposition were killed. Nobody from the ruling party was killed or disappeared  only members of the opposition.”\n\nShe believes that asylum seekers “don’t have a future in Rwanda” and questioned what will happen at the end of the UK Government’s five-year trial scheme.\n\n“I am wondering what will happen after five years if the British government will no longer pay the Rwanda government ” she said.\n\n“The British government now pays for where they stay. If the British government stops giving this money what will happen with them?\n\n“Many young people in Rwanda don’t have a job. This doesn’t mean that the government has jobs to offer these refugees. Rwanda is a poor country.”\n\nA UK Government spokesperson said: “Rwanda is a safe country and has previously been recognised for providing a safe haven for refugees – we will not be deterred in delivering our plans to fix the broken asylum system which will ultimately save lives.”\n\ni has contacted the Government of Rwanda for comment.'],asylum seeker send uk rwanda flee african country risk death use people smuggle gang reach europe country opposition leader say n nvictoire ingabire umuhoza brand government rwanda dictatorial regime doesnt care asylum seeker send britain n nshe accuse uk government breach uns refugee convention rwanda policy say surprised learn home office scheme cost uk taxpayer million five year n nthe government rwanda know refugee stay rwanda ms ingabire tell accepted deal n nm ingabire lead critic president paul kagame spend eight year prison convict genocide denial follow return rwanda exile take part presidential election n nthis dictatorial regime say power hand president kagame justice judge free parliament cant anything make decision n nwhen ask threat asylum seeker turn people smuggler leave rwanda deport ms ingabire point estimate asylum seeker deport israel rwanda uganda secret deal proof arrive uk also leave n nthe majority escape almost immediately many attempt return europe via people smuggle route n nwhere refugees israel send rwanda longer rwanda say leave go back europe n nthat happen refugee uk send rwanda prison right go want n nthat mean stay rwanda government rwanda know n nin oxford university study find eritrean sudanese migrant send israel rwanda uganda make dangerous journey south sudan sudan libya en route europe n nduring journey subject human traffic incarceration threat forcible deportation eritrea harsh condition starvation violence slavery torture camp libya n nafter face dangerous cross mediterranean sea libya europe n nms ingabire member hutu ethnic group hand year jail sentence question rwanda official memorial genocide include hutu n nfive eight year jail spend solitary confinement release presidential pardon unable leave country government bar visit husband child netherlands n nthe leader opposition dalfa umurinzi party believe conviction politically motivate n neverybody know rwanda know country democracy human right respect say n nthe british government know know rwandas government respect human right decide send refugee country like rwanda n nthe geneva convention say cant send refugee country know liberty could danger n nshe say four member opposition kill four disappeared recent year rwandan government unable provide answer n nin two year four member political party disappear four others kill say n nuntil today rwanda government can not explain killed people problem member opposition kill nobody rule party kill disappeared member opposition n nshe believe asylum seeker dont future rwanda question happen end uk government five year trial scheme n ni wonder happen five year british government long pay rwanda government say n nthe british government pay stay british government stop give money happen n nmany young people rwanda dont job doesnt mean government job offer refugee rwanda poor country n na uk government spokesperson say rwanda safe country previously recognise provide safe refugee deter deliver plan fix break asylum system ultimately save life n ni contacted government rwanda comment,0.5778060131420921,1

The multi-ton semi-tractor trailer rig has a spherical iron chamber that is designed to safely detonate explosives.\n\nMoore said less than 10 pounds of material was placed in the chamber  far less than its safety rating.\n\nSeventeen people have been injured in Los Angeles after a cache of homemade fireworks exploded as it was being destroyed by a bomb squad  damaging cars and smashing windows in homes\n\nThe LAPD initially said the cause of the explosion was unknown  but later confirmed that it had occurred as the bomb squad was detonating the explosives in the vehicle\n\nThe wreckage of the truck is seen behind a police cordon on Wednesday night\n\nThe LAPD initially said the cause of the explosion  which happened on the 700 block of East 27th street  was unknown  but later confirmed that it had occurred as the bomb squad was detonating the explosives in the vehicle.\n\n'This vessel should have been able to safely dispose of that material ' LAPD Chief Michel Moore said at a press conference on Wednesday night.\n\n'And you saw the resulting damage  and the total catastrophic failure of that containment vehicle ' Moore said.\n\n'Something happened in that containment vehicle that should not have happened  and we don't know why ' Moore said.

Los Angeles police injure 17 in explosion after detonating fireworks ...,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/01/los-angeles-police-fireworks-explosion,['The Los Angeles police department detonated a cache of homemade fireworks it had seized  causing a major explosion on a residential block that injured 17 people  flipped and damaged cars and smashed windows in nearby homes.\n\nIt could take days to determine why what was supposed to be a safe operation to handle explosives that police said were too unstable to remove turned into a huge explosion.\n\nPolice exploded the devices at about 7.30pm on Wednesday in an iron containment vessel on a tractor-trailer in a South Los Angeles neighborhood  believing the vehicle would be able to contain the explosion. But there was a “total catastrophic failure of that containment vehicle”  the LA police chief  Michel Moore  said  according to the LA Times.\n\n“Clearly  protocols were followed and pursued. But something happened in that containment vessel that should not have happened and we don’t know why ” the chief added. “But we intend to find out why.”\n\nHomes  cars and a laundromat had windows shattered and one car had its side plowed in and was knocked on its side by the force of the blast.\n\nThe blast sent nine police officers and a federal Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives officer to the hospital with minor injuries  the fire chief  Ralph M Terrazas  said.\n\nSix civilians  ranging from 51 to 85 years old  were taken to the hospital  three with minor and three with moderate injuries  and one person was examined at the scene but was not transported  fire officials said.\n\nNews reports showed several people on gurneys being taken to ambulances.\n\nFireworks are illegal to sell or possess in Los Angeles and in unincorporated areas of the county but “every year  we see the devastation and destruction” from them  Terrazas said.\n\nMichel Moore  center  talks to the media after illegal fireworks seized at a South Los Angeles home exploded. Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/AP\n\nAuthorities said the blast illustrated the dangers of underground pyrotechnic sales. In March  a fireworks explosion at a home in Ontario  east of Los Angeles  left two people dead and caused at least $3.2m in damage.\n\nThe explosion on Wednesday came after police had spent the day disposing of some 3 000 to 5 000 pounds of commercial-grade fireworks that were found in the home following an early-morning tip. Police found some them on a patio in cartons stacked eight to 10 feet high  Moore said.\n\nThe fireworks cartons were marked “Made in China” and were bought out of state in order to sell them in the neighborhood for use on the Fourth of July  according to Moore.\n\nThe bomb squad was called because the large volume of explosives at the home posed an “imminent and real danger“ to the community  Moore said.\n\nThree box trucks and a 53ft trailer were brought in to load up the fireworks and move them to a safe location  the chief said. However  officers also found “improvised explosives” that were too dangerous to move.\n\nThose materials were taken to a “total containment vehicle”  Moore explained  a multi-ton semi-tractor trailer rig with a spherical iron chamber that is designed to safely detonate explosives.\n\nMoore said less than 10lb of material was placed in the chamber  far less than its safety rating.\n\n“This vessel should have been able to dispose of that material ” he said.\n\nAs a safety measure  police had knocked on doors before the blast to evacuate homes on both sides of the street where the truck was parked. But firefighters later found people in some of the homes  Terrazas said.\n\nDespite shattered windows  Terrazas said the explosion seemed to have caused mainly superficial damage to homes and gas and water lines were intact.\n\nMoore said a response team consisting of members from around the country would be arriving in town to examine the site and walk through it for an investigation that could take several days. The chief also said the blast might have thrown debris and possibly dangerous material some distance.\n\nA 27-year-old resident was arrested on suspicion of possessing a destructive device but he also may face charges of child endangerment because his 10-year-old brother was in the home  Moore said.'],los angeles police department detonate cache homemade firework seize cause major explosion residential block injure people flip damaged car smash window nearby home n nit could take day determine suppose safe operation handle explosives police say unstable remove turn huge explosion n npolice explode device pm wednesday iron containment vessel tractor trailer south los angeles neighborhood believing vehicle would able contain explosion total catastrophic failure containment vehicle la police chief michel moore say accord la time n nclearly protocol follow pursue something happen containment vessel happen dont know chief added intend find n nhomes car laundromat window shatter one car side plow knocked side force blast n nthe blast send nine police officer federal bureau alcohol tobacco firearms explosives officer hospital minor injury fire chief ralph terrazas say n nsix civilian range year old take hospital three minor three moderate injury one person examine scene transport fire official say n nnews report show several people gurneys take ambulance n nfireworks illegal sell possess los angeles unincorporated area county every year see devastation destruction terrazas say n nmichel moore center talk medium illegal firework seize south los angeles home explode photograph ringo hw chiu ap n nauthorities say blast illustrate danger underground pyrotechnic sale march fireworks explosion home ontario east los angeles leave two people dead cause least damage n nthe explosion wednesday come police spent day dispose pound commercial grade firework find home follow early morning tip police find patio carton stack eight foot high moore say n nthe firework carton mark make china buy state order sell neighborhood use fourth july accord moore n nthe bomb squad call large volume explosives home pose imminent real danger community moore say n nthree box truck ft trailer bring load firework move safe location chief say however officer also find improvised explosive dangerous move n nthose material take total containment vehicle moore explain multi ton semi tractor trailer rig spherical iron chamber design safely detonate explosive n nmoore say less lb material place chamber far less safety rating n nthis vessel able dispose material say n na safety measure police knock door blast evacuate home side street truck park firefighter later find people home terrazas say n ndespite shattered window terrazas say explosion seem cause mainly superficial damage home gas water line intact n nmoore say response team consist member around country would arrive town examine site walk investigation could take several day chief also say blast might throw debris possibly dangerous material distance n na year old resident arrest suspicion possess destructive device also may face charge child endangerment year old brother home moore say,0.629403409207306,1
Simi Valley fireworks: 28 injured in accidental detonation,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-simi-fireworks-folo-20130704-story.html,['At least 28 people suffered minor to severe injuries Thursday night when fireworks exploded and shot into the crowd during a Fourth of July celebration in Simi Valley  authorities said.\n\nThe accidental detonation occurred about 9:20 p.m. during a professional fireworks display attended by thousands of people at the Rancho Santa Susana Community Park on East Los Angeles Avenue.\n\n“There was a big boom. Everybody started running down the street. People were screaming ” said Justice Allen  17  of Simi Valley. “Everybody was just terrified. People hid in bushes.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllen said she had just arrived at the park after getting off work when fireworks started flying over the fences and sparks passed by her and her friend.\n\nDRAMATIC VIDEOS OF ACCIDENT\n\nAnother witness  Annisa Wynn  told KTLA-TV Channel 5 that the explosion occurred about two minutes into the show. Fireworks suddenly began shooting sideways along the ground into the crowd instead of up in the air  she said.\n\n“The fireworks were so close  you could see them on the ground ” Wynn said. “It never happens this way. People were screaming.”\n\nAmid the chaos  Ventura County firefighters set up a triage center in the park  where they treated adults and children  many of them hit by flying debris. Some people were taken by ambulance to area hospitals.\n\nPHOTOS: Simi Valley fireworks accident\n\nMost of the injuries were described as shrapnel-like injuries or burns. No fatalities were reported.\n\nTaken to the hospital were four people with moderate to severe injuries and 16 with minor injuries. The rest were treated and released at the scene.\n\nSimi Valley Police Cmdr. John Parks said the Fourth of July event was heavily staffed with police  park rangers and firefighters who were able to treat the injured almost immediately after the explosion.\n\nParks also said the public cooperated with authorities and quickly evacuated the park after the blast.\n\nJai Kohli  30  of Pasadena  said there were about 10 000 people at the show and there was a lot of confusion after the explosion occurred. (Authorities said the crowd was estimated at 8 000 to 10 000.)\n\nHe recalled that one of the fireworks exploded low to the ground with a lot of force. “People around me instinctively ducked ” he said.\n\nHazciel Vidrio  26  of Simi Valley  said he and his family have attended the event the last several years  but “this was completely unexpected.”\n\nAfter four or five rockets went straight up  he said  there was a loud blast and he realized that something was wrong.\n\n“A lot of kids were screaming and crying ” Vidrio said. “People were trying to get away from the fireworks as fast as they could and were running into each other.”\n\n[Updated at 11:55 p.m. July 4: Police Cmdr. Stephanie Shannon said there is no indication of foul play and that the explosion appears to have been an industrial accident. She added that the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department bomb squad would remove the unexploded fireworks that remained at the park Thursday night.

Rwanda follows its opposition and kills them - New Frame,https://www.newframe.com/rwanda-follows-its-opposition-and-kills-them/,['David Batenga suspected something was wrong when he was unable to get hold of his uncle  renowned Rwandan dissident and former chief of intelligence Colonel Patrick Karegeya  for more than 24 hours on 1 January 2014.\n\n“I was starting to get worried … You sent him a message  within five minutes he always responded. His phones were always accessible. Even an hour without contacting me  that’s … never heard of ” Batenga said.\n\nAfter determining his uncle was checked in at the Michelangelo Hotel in Sandton  Johannesburg  staff advised Batenga they could access the room only in the presence of the police  despite Batenga’s growing distress.\n\nPolice entered the suite and found Karegeya’s body in the room. “I sat for 45 minutes  almost an hour. So what they did  the cops came  they used the stairs  they went to the room  they manned the scene  everything was done. After  only after  the lady from the reception came and sat with me … When she told me  it was hard. I was hysterical  you can imagine ” Batenga said.\n\nBatenga believes his uncle was killed because he was an outspoken critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame and his government. Less than two weeks after Karegeya’s death  the BBC quoted Kagame as saying: “You can’t betray Rwanda and not get punished for it. Anyone  even those still alive  will reap the consequences. Anyone. It is a matter of time.”\n\nThe Randburg Magistrate’s Court has set down January 2019 for the inquest into Karegeya’s death  with prosecutors lining up more than 30 witnesses for the hearing  including Batenga and Karegeya’s wife  who has been living in the United States after she fled Johannesburg with her children over safety concerns before the murder.\n\nKaregeya  who used to be a supporter of Kagame  became disillusioned with the Rwandan president’s rule after he was jailed twice for spurious charges of insubordination. Karegeya was stripped of his rank of colonel in 2006 and went into exile in South Africa the following year. With a number of prominent critics of Kagame  he founded the exiled opposition party the Rwanda National Congress in 2010.\n\nEarlier this month  the Constitutional Court heard an application by Alex Ruta  a former Rwandan intelligence officer who was sent to South Africa to assassinate members of the Rwanda National Congress  not to be deported to Rwanda. Ruta refused to carry out his mission when he realised it amounted to assassination  and instead approached the Hawks with the details of his assignment.\n\nAssassinations and attempted hits on critics of Kagame in South Africa are nothing new  with dissidents still having to look over their shoulders. Former army chief General Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa has survived a number of assassination attempts – six people faced trial in South Africa for trying to kill him in 2010. The latest attempt on his life came a few months after Karegeya was killed. For Batenga  living in paranoia has become an “exhausting lifestyle”.\n\nHe said despite the delays in the case  the family was happy a court date had been set. “It is the first step. We are excited about it. Obviously it resonates with hope that it is coming right … though we hold a view that this inquest is not even necessary. Investigations are done and complete. We know who did this  so it is not a case of wondering … We have evidence  we have reports. How it goes in the inquest  we don’t know  but we are still excited ” he said.\n\nIt was the period of silence after Karegeya’s death  with all the family’s unanswered questions  that bothered Batenga. “When it dies off  that is when it is even more painful. When it’s in court  I don’t mind how tedious and exhaustive it can get  but when it dies off and you phone people and they don’t answer or they block you…” he trailed off.\n\nBut Batenga  like the uncle who raised him and saw him through school  will remain critical of Kagame’s government until Rwanda becomes safe for its leader’s political opponents. “Always  you can never stop ” Batenga said defiantly. “For how long can you detach yourself from who you are? It’s not about many deaths or many assassinations. It’s a view that I hold and many other Rwandans who live outside the borders to have access to their own country.”\n\nFrank Ntwali  an executive member of the Rwanda National Congress  said he was hopeful the outcome of the inquest would shed light on the Rwandan government’s “impunity”.\n\n“In Rwanda  they have painted a very fake narrative of a government that is progressive  that is respecting human rights  that is a model of development  yet it is the worst regime in east and central Africa in terms of … human rights ” he said. “It is the only government that follows its own opposition and kills them outside the country.”\n\nHe said Karegeya’s death was just one of “endless assassinations” by the Rwandan government. “It should be on record that Patrick [Karegeya] … was assassinated by the government of Rwanda … That should be very clear to the whole world.”\n\nNtwali said “measures should be taken against this rogue government”  adding that the Rwanda National Congress would seek further justice for the family once the inquest had been finalised. “We want to hold the government of Rwanda accountable  but we all know that the government … does not care about relations with other countries ” he said.'],david batenga suspect something wrong unable get hold uncle renowned rwandan dissident former chief intelligence colonel patrick karegeya hour january n ni start get worried sent message within five minute always respond phone always accessible even hour without contact thats never hear batenga say n nafter determine uncle check michelangelo hotel sandton johannesburg staff advise batenga could access room presence police despite batengas grow distress n npolice enter suite find karegeyas body room sit minute almost hour cop come use stair go room man scene everything do lady reception come sat tell hard hysterical imagine batenga say n nbatenga believe uncle kill outspoken critic rwandan president paul kagame government less two week karegeyas death bbc quote kagame say cant betray rwanda get punish anyone even still alive reap consequence anyone matter time n nthe randburg magistrate court set january inquest karegeyas death prosecutor line witness hear include batenga karegeyas wife living united state flee johannesburg child safety concern murder n nkaregeya use supporter kagame become disillusioned rwandan president rule jail twice spurious charge insubordination karegeya strip rank colonel go exile south africa follow year number prominent critic kagame found exiled opposition party rwanda national congress n nearlier month constitutional court hear application alex ruta former rwandan intelligence officer send south africa assassinate member rwanda national congress deport rwanda ruta refuse carry mission realise amounted assassination instead approach hawk detail assignment n nassassinations attempt hit critic kagame south africa nothing new dissident still look shoulder former army chief general faustin kayumba nyamwasa survive number assassination attempt six people face trial south africa try kill late attempt life come month karegeya kill batenga live paranoia become exhaust lifestyle n nhe say despite delay case family happy court date set first step excite obviously resonate hope come right though hold view inquest even necessary investigation do complete know case wonder evidence report go inquest dont know still excite say n nit period silence karegeyas death family unanswered question bother batenga dy even painful court dont mind tedious exhaustive get die phone people dont answer block trail n nbut batenga like uncle raise saw school remain critical kagames government rwanda become safe leader political opponent always never stop batenga say defiantly long detach many death many assassination view hold many rwandan live outside border access country n nfrank ntwali executive member rwanda national congress say hopeful outcome inquest would shed light rwandan government impunity n nin rwanda paint fake narrative government progressive respect human right model development yet bad regime east central africa term human right say government follow opposition kill outside country n nhe say karegeyas death one endless assassination rwandan government record patrick karegeya assassinated government rwanda clear whole world n nntwali say measure take rogue government add rwanda national congress would seek justice family inquest finalise want hold government rwanda accountable know government care relation country say,0.590419001265616,1

UPDATE 3-Missing Rwandan opposition figure found dead,https://www.reuters.com/article/rwanda-opposition-death-idAFLDE66D0TF20100714,['* Police suspect robbery\n\n* Party claims body almost decapitated\n\n(Adds quotes  details)\n\nKIGALI  July 14 (Reuters) - The body of a leading member of a yet to be registered political party has been found near his abandoned car weeks ahead of a presidential election  his party and police said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Democratic Green Party’s vice president  Andre Kagwa Rwisereka  was reported missing early on Tuesday. His pick-up truck was found in wetlands near the Mukula river close to the southern city of Butare.\n\nThe death is likely to raise tensions before August’s presidential election  which President Paul Kagame is expected to win. The Democratic Green Party has however been unable to register to take part in the election.\n\nPolice have begun an investigation into the killing and say the motive is unknown at present  although they suspect robbery.\n\n“His body was found this morning 3 km (2 miles) from where his car was found  along with a large knife which may have been used in the killing. It was a kind of machete ” police spokesman Eric Kayiranga said.\n\n“People who saw him that night say he had a lot of money  so it is suspected it may be a robbery case. Investigations have begun.”\n\nKayiranga said Rwisereka had chest wounds and his body had been taken to hospital. The Democratic Green Party say it has been taken to the mortuary for an autopsy.\n\nAnalysts and rights groups say Rwanda  which has positioned itself as a donor darling and investment magnet in recent years  has shown signs of increasing political repression \n\nRwanda has rejected the accusations and says the government has pursued dialogue and accepted opposing views since the 1994 genocide.\n\n“The simple fact of the matter is it will be perceived as a political killing  regardless if it was or not  and this will serve to heighten the tension in Rwanda ” a Western diplomat who declined to be named told Reuters.\n\nRights groups say the shooting of a dissident Rwandan general in South Africa  the murder of a critical journalist and the arrest of two presidential aspirants in recent months show a growing intolerance of dissent in Kigali.\n\nRwanda firmly denies being linked to either shooting and says the arrested politicians had violated anti-genocide legislation aimed at avoiding a repeat of the 1994 genocide.\n\nCarina Tertsakian  a Rwanda researcher for New York-based Human Rights Watch  said that while it was too early to know who was behind the killing  the death of an opposition figure would have a chilling effect on the political scene.\n\n“There needs to be proper and thorough investigations into each of these cases to establish exactly what happened. So we can’t point the finger directly  but there’s certainly a pattern emerging  a very worrying pattern ” she told Reuters by telephone from London.\n\nFrank Habineza  founding President of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda  said Rwisereka may have been decapitated  and that he now fears for his own life.\n\n“His brother Antoine Haguma has seen the body and confirmed that his head was almost removed  cut off from his body ” he told Reuters.\n\n“Personally I’m very scared because ... I’ve received death threats  that I was supposed to be killed before the election. My vice president is now dead  I’m very scared.”\n\nHabineza added that he suspected Rwisereka was not carrying money when he went missing.\n\n“As far as money is concerned  he left 600 000 Rwandan francs ($1 000) with his sister the night before  which she was supposed to bank before he came to Kigali... so he was not carrying money with him ” Habineza said.

"Jerusalem bombings: Teenager killed, 19 others injured",https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-723133,"['At least one person was killed and 19 wounded in two explosions in bus stops at separate entrances to Jerusalem on Wednesday morning  in what police are treating as a coordinated double terror attack.\n\nThe fatality was identified as 16-year-old Aryeh Shechopek  who was on his way to a yeshiva in a nearby community when the explosion occurred. The Israeli-Canadian citizen lived in the capital’s Har Nof neighborhood.\n\nBoth explosions  one at the entrance to the city near the Central Bus Station and the other in the Ramot neighborhood  occurred at bus stops during rush hour. The explosive devices were said to have been placed in bags left at the stations.\n\nThe first explosion  which happened shortly after 7 a.m. in Givat Shaul  injured 15 people  including two critically and another four seriously.\n\nMagen David Adom said that 12 people were transported to hospitals across the city for medical treatment. Six of the injured people were evacuated to Shaare Tzedek Medical Center  two in critical condition  four in serious condition  and one moderately injured. Five of the moderately wounded were transported to Hadassah University Medical Center in Ein Kerem  and one was admitted to Hadassah’s Mount Scopus hospital in moderate condition.\n\nPolice and security personnel at the scene of a terror attack in Jerusalem  on November 23  2022. (credit: OLIVIER FITOUSSI/FLASH90)\n\nOne of the injured was Naomi Pilichowski  the daughter of Uri Pilichowski  a Jerusalem Post columnist and a well-known American-Israeli educator who works at Nefesh B’Nefesh  and Mitzpe Yericho Mayor Aliza Pilichowski. She was lightly injured in the attack.\n\nAvi Biton  the father of another teenager who was seriously wounded in the attack with shrapnel in his head and stomach  said that his son and a friend were sitting on a bench waiting for a ride to their yeshiva when they suddenly heard a large explosion that threw them in the air. He said that his son saw a suspicious-looking man taking pictures of them before disappearing.\n\nWitnesses said that they had spotted a bag leaning against a wall shortly before the explosion although these claims have not yet been verified. However  according to N12  the blast was caused by a device set up on a motorcycle next to the bus stop.\n\nThe bombs were detonated remotely and were reportedly packed with nails and bolts to maximum casualties. One bus that was near the scene of the first attack was riddled with holes  showing the dispersion of shrapnel.\n\nFollowing the attack  Road One - the main artery into the capital - was shut to incoming traffic from the direction of Tel Aviv for several hours.\n\nThe second explosion near the Ramot Intersection in northern Jerusalem took place several moments after the initial explosion. Three people were lightly injured in that attack.\n\nThe second explosive device was most likely set up on the fence  according to an N12 report.\n\nPolice  security officials  piece together picture of events\n\nFollowing an initial investigation at both scenes  police are treating the two explosions as a coordinated joint attack and are looking for additional explosive devices across the city.\n\nCCTV captured the moment of the explosion that killed an Israeli teenager at the entrance to Jerusalem this morning. pic.twitter.com/zXnN7KiIkf — Anna Ahronheim (@AAhronheim) November 23  2022\n\n“An initial police investigation taken by Israeli police saboteurs at both scenes shows that different explosive charges were placed at both scenes. It is suspected that this is a combined terror attack ” the police said in a statement.\n\nPolice Commissioner Kobi Shabtai arrived to the scene of the initial explosion where he was briefed on the attack and then held a situational assessment with Jerusalem District Commander Superintendent Doron Turgeman.\n\nSpeaking at the scene  Shabtai said that every bus in Jerusalem will be searched by police officers and all of the bomb-sniffing dogs in Israel will be activated to search for explosive devices. He added that police are investigating whether or not there was more than one terrorist involved in either attack.\n\n""The goal is to prevent the next explosion "" he said. ""This means bringing all the forces out  not only here  but also to other areas. It could be one terrorist that placed the two explosives  or it could be two. All intelligence services will focus on this issue.""\n\nIDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi decided to cut his ongoing visit to the US short after a situation assessment on Wednesday afternoon  according to the IDF Spokesperson\'s Unit. Kohavi is expected to land in Israel on Thursday.\n\n“A boy who did nothing wrong to anyone in the world was murdered only because he was Jewish ” said Prime Minister Yair Lapid. “An extensive intelligence effort is now underway that will lead to the discovery of the despicable terrorists  who are behind them and who supplied them with weapons.”\n\n“I want to tell the citizens of Israel that we will get to them ” he continued. “They can run  they can hide  but it won’t help them. Security forces will get to them. If they resist  they will be taken out. If not  we will deal with them to the full extent of the law.”\n\nCanada’s Ambassador to Israel  Lisa Stadelbauer  posted on Twitter that she was “heartbroken” to confirm that Shtsupak was a Canadian citizen in the “reprehensible terror attack.”\n\n“Our sincere condolences to his family and friends  and to others wounded in this attack. Canada continues to condemn all forms of terror ” she wrote.\n\nUS Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides confirmed on Wednesday evening that two US citizens had been injured in the bombing attack. ""As we head into Thanksgiving  I am grateful that they will recover. I pray for a peaceful holiday in the US  Jerusalem  or wherever you may be celebrating "" tweeted Nides.\n\nJerusalem mayor Moshe Lion told N12 that there had been no specific warning ahead of the attacks and that they had been “surprised” by it. Nevertheless  Deputy Commissioner Sigal Bar-Tzvi  head of Israel Police\'s Operations Department  told Kan that there had been “early intelligence” on an attack of this type that would happen in Jerusalem.\n\n“This is an organized squad and not a spontaneous attack ” she said.\n\nThough no group has taken responsibility for the attack  Hamas praised it with its spokesperson Abd al-Latif al-Qanua saying that it was “in response to the occupation and its settlers\' crimes against our people and Al-Aqsa Mosque.”\n\nDefense Minister Benny Gantz held a situational assessment along with head of the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) Ronen Bar  Deputy Chief of Staff Maj.-Gen. Amir Baram  IDF Military Intelligence head Maj.-Gen. Aharon Haliva  Coordinator for Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) Maj.-Gen. Ghasan Alyan and other senior police and defense ministry officials.\n\n“There are many elements in the region that try to destabilize - we work against them all the time  on all fronts. The time of the perpetrators of the attacks  the planners of the attacks  and the financiers of the attacks is limited ” Gantz warned following a situational assessment at the IDF\'s Central Command.\n\n“We have an excellent army  police and security service - who will make sure to get their hands on them  and will continue to thwart terrorism. Anywhere  anytime and by any means ” he continued  adding that security forces have been deployed and that intelligence gathering has been increased.\n\nPrime Minister Yair Lapid conducted a situational assessment at noon in the Defense Ministry Headquarters at the Kirya in Tel Aviv. He will be joined by Gantz  Shabtai  Bar  Baram  Public Security Minister Omer Bar Lev  National Security Agency head Eyal Haluta and other senior officials.\n\nFollowing the assessment  Lapid briefed prime minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu on the meeting.\n\nPolice operate at the scene of a Jerusalem terror attack after two bombs exploded at the bus stops near the entrance to the city  November 23  2022. (credit: MARC ISRAEL SELLEM/THE JERUSALEM POST)\n\nReactions to the Jerusalem bombings\n\n“A boy who did nothing wrong to anyone in the world was murdered only because he was Jewish ” said Prime Minister Yair Lapid. “An extensive intelligence effort is now underway that will lead to the discovery of the despicable terrorists  who are behind them and who supplied them with weapons.”\n\n""I want to say from here to the citizens of Israel  we will reach them. They can run  they can hide  it won\'t help them. The security forces will reach them. If they resist they will be thwarted. If not  we will exhaust the full severity of the law with them.""\n\nNetanyahu visited several of the wounded people in Shaare Zedek Medical Center on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAddressing the press at the end of his visit he said: ""I think I am speaking for most of the people of Israel  who are all praying for the full recovery of the wounded. We are in a fight against ruthless terror  which is on the rise again  and we will do everything we can to return a full sense of security to all Israelis.""\n\nLikud party chairman MK Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to the media at the Shaare Tzedek hospital in Jerusalem on November 23  2022. (credit: OLIVIER FITOUSSI/FLASH90)\n\nPresident Isaac Herzog attended a ceremony for the Ethiopian Jewish holiday of Sigd on Wednesday in Armon Hanatziv  Jerusalem  and addressed the terror attack that had occurred earlier in the day.\n\n""I want to address the difficult day  a day full of anxiety  worry and pain  that is felt around Israel and Jerusalem. This terror attack will not weaken us  will not make us doubt our belief in our ways  or in our right to a peaceful and safe life in Israel  including in our eternal capital of Jerusalem "" he said.\n\n""We will continue to be strong against hateful and despicable terrorists  and we will prove that there is no power in the world that can break the Israeli spirit. In the name of the Israeli people  I send my condolences to the families of the injured and I pray for the health of the injured people.\n\n""I send my support to the security forces  which I fully trust to operate with all of their might to defeat the terror in general  and those in charge of the attack today.""\n\nPresident Isaac Herzog attends a Sigd Holiday ceremony in Jerusalem  November 23  2022. (credit: CHAIM TZACH/GPO)\n\nAlong with an outpouring of responses to the attack from foreign diplomats  the US Office of Palestinian Affairs tweeted to denounce the violence that occurred.\n\n""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this morning’s terrorist attacks on public locations in Jerusalem  and offer sincere condolences to the victims and their loved ones. We are closely monitoring the situation. Terrorism is a dead end that accomplishes absolutely nothing "" they wrote  in both English and Arabic.\n\nSimilarly  US ambassador to Israel Tom Nides sent a message via Twitter expressing anger over the attack and extending his condolences to the families of those affected.\n\n""Appalled by the cowardly terrorist attacks in Jerusalem today that targeted innocent civilians  including children. My heart breaks for the families of those who were harmed.""\n\nIsrael\'s battle with Palestinian terrorism\n\nIn recent months  Israel has been experiencing a wave of terrorism  although the attacks until now have mostly been in the West Bank and were carried out by Palestinians using either assault rifles or knives. Last week  three Israelis were killed in a stabbing rampage at the entrance to the settlement of Ariel in the Shomron region of the West Bank.\n\nAlso last week  a car exploded close to an IDF post near the settlement of Mevo Dotan in the West Bank. The car  which had three gas cylinders and wires inside  is believed to have exploded in a botched car bombing.\n\nThe Shin Bet said that it had thwarted over 330 significant attacks in the past year  including 34 bombings and two suicide bombings.\n\nOperation Break the Wave was launched in April by the IDF to crack down on Palestinian terror attacks after 20 people were killed in Israel during terror attacks. Since the beginning of the operation  another 14 civilians have been killed  along with four members of the security forces.\n\nOver 2 000 Palestinians have been arrested by security forces and over 130 killed by Israeli fire during violent riots and while attempting to carry out terror attacks.\n\nLahav Harkov contributed to this report.']",least one person kill wound two explosion bus stop

Her parents  now unemployed in Rwanda  worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class  three years behind where she should be  due to conflict  and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school  run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR  is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.

The school is one of several projects funded by Educate A Child (EAC) a global programme run by the EAA Foundation. While some neighbouring countries also shouldering the burden of conflict have seen their citizens push back against the influx of refugees  Rwanda appears to have created an environment of relative calm  with both children from the refugee community and the host nation sat side by side in class.

We have a family wedding soon and I would like to invite some of my friends from school who came from DRC.” Emammeli dreams of becoming a football player.

At GS Gasaka  Mutoni has many friends and likes going to school; she says she is “gaining a lot” and “acquiring skills”. For Mutoni  “life is good here in Rwanda”. She encourages “all women and girls to go to school  because it’s the only place where you can develop your skills and learn a lot”.

When the refugees came  I was a child and I didn’t notice any difference between them and us.” To anyone who doesn’t think the refugees should be let in  he says: “Let them come and go to school.

Paddy Dowling/EAA School children of Rwanda Juvence  12  arrived seeking sanctuary in Rwanda five years ago with his family fleeing the conflict in DRC. He is one of five siblings  his mother is a school teacher at GS Gasaka school and his father volunteers with INGOs operating in Kigeme camp. Juvence’s best friend in school is 11-year-old Rwandan Samuel Tuyishime  in class 6. Juvence loves to play football and hopes someday he will fulfil his dreams and turn professional.

Even in the most remote places  children learn how to entertain themselves  and for the thousands that have fled the DRC  now living in the many camps in Rwanda  the dust of the camp floor provides a surface on which all games are possible. Paddy Dowling/EAA\n\nLewis Mudge  central Africa directors at Human Rights Watch  called for an investigation that would examine the possibility that Mihigo ”could have been ill-treated or killed in custody”.\n\n“Too often  sensitive cases in Rwanda result in mysterious deaths or disappearances ” he said.\n\nMihigo – whose music explores issues around the Rwanda genocide – had previously been jailed for conspiracy to murder or harm Rwanda’s president  Paul Kagame  and other top officials.\n\nHe was also found guilty of complicity to overthrow the government.\n\nMr Kagame pardoned Mihigo – along with Rwanda‘s leading opposition leader  Victoire Ingabire – in 2018  three years after the gospel musician’s conviction.\n\nPolice said his attempt to escape the country nullified the pardon.\n\nHis new charges included attempt to illegally cross to Burundi  joining terrorist groups and corruption  according to the Rwanda Investigation Bureau.\n\nMihigo was a well-known singer in Rwanda who used to sing the national anthem at important national events.\n\nHe was arrested in 2014 weeks after releasing “The Meaning of Death”  a song which seemed to challenge the official narrative of the genocide.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health  you can receive confidential support at Samaritans by calling 116

...",https://rwandainspirer.com/2017/12/03/man-injured-another-detained-by-police-as-the-two-appeal-for-their-payment/,['Security\n\nBy Elias Hakizimana &\n\nRachid Bugirimfura\n\nTwo men Rukundo A.K.A Gasongo and his colleague Hamimu Niyonkuru aggressively packed into Kimironko sector’s security and hygiene car.\n\nRukundo was injured on his head due to a violent-forced action of packing him in a car after the duo were asking for their payment from a liquor club called “Magestic liquor & Wine” located in Nyagatovu cell.\n\nThe incident took place on Friday midnight around 12 am.\n\nThe men who were not also in a good position due to alcohol consumption at that moment were coming to ask for their payment from the club owner after they made chairs for her and instead of paying them called District Administration Security Support Organ (DASSO) from Kimironko sector who came in a while by taking the men as if there were stones and put in a car where Rukundo’s head was injured.\n\nEye witnesses who were there criticize such a security organ (DASSO) for usual illegal action of violating human beings’ health instead of playing the role of gathering peace and security.\n\nRukundo works with his colleague Niyonkuru who was taken as detainee at Kimironko police station after the incident occurred.\n\nLouise Uwimbabazi is the servant at the club who was there during the incident.\n\nShe confirmed to The Inspirer that security organs who intervened behaved inhuman while packing the men in a car  injuring Rukundo who did not even fight with anybody before.\n\n“I do not understand why you are asking me where the man was injured from  he was injured after being taken in a car by Security officials  and yourself have been there ” Louise told the journalist.\n\nTrying to chat with Kimironko sector’s DASSO security organ in the morning soon after the incident  they said they had nothing to report and recommended the journalist to contact the executive secretary.\n\nNyiridandi Mapambano  Kimironko sector’s executive secretary on phone call with The Inspirer said that the man was injured by his colleague after both were fighting  which is not true as the journalist himself was at the incident’s place as the eye witness.\n\n“The man was injured as they were fighting themselves and they were drunkard  security organs went there to intervene after being called by observers  they were both taken to Kimironko police station and the one who was injured was taken later to Kibagabaga hospital by the sectors’ security and hygiene car to be handled ” said Nyiridandi.\n\n“We will follow up to see the way those men were transported and punish kind of illegal conduct on how they detained those people  we have the entity that punishes them as other employees of the district  whenever they act in contrary to the ethical regulations of their work ” he added.\n\nWe tried later to visit the police station of Kimironko where Hamimu Niyonkuru was under arrest and the police officer refused to let us talk with the detainee  saying that they will follow on DASSO who committed such a critical intervention.\n\nAs we proceeded to Kibagabaga hospital where Rukundo who was injured was taken in the same morning  a medical official said that the patient refused to be treated as he was in a mood of drunkard  saying that he is not sick.\n\nSpeaking to Niyonkuru today  he said he was released by police yesterday after some hours in prison.\n\nHe said security officials’ intervention for security matters remains critical as they detain innocent people instead of handling their problems.\n\n“I was coming to ask my money for the job I did for the bar owner  she refused to answer my phone call until the night  and we came to wait for her at the club  my colleague who I employed was also asking me for his pay  we had not even transport to go home  they came to detain me saying we were causing security shortage  it was between 11 and 12 midnight ” said Niyonkuru.\n\nNiyonkuru also criticizes the way DASSO security organ handles issues related to security while on their usual interventions.\n\n“DASSO are used to mistreating people when they are called for security intervention as they look the noble’s side instead of following on the root cause of the issue on the ground ” he said.\n\nThe bar owner who withheld her names said she was not involved in such an incident as she was not there.'],security n nby elias hakizimana n nrachid bugirimfura n ntwo men rukundo k gasongo colleague hamimu niyonkuru

The explosion took place on the famous Istiklal shopping street of Istanbul  which is often crowded with people and tourists.\n\nThe death toll of the Istanbul explosion currently stands at six  while the number of people injured in the blast has risen up to 81  according to local media reports. The cause behind the explosion is not yet known  but it is being speculated that it was a terrorist attack.\n\nAccording to several reports  the bombing was carried out by a female attacker. Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay  while addressing the nation  said that it was suspected that a female terrorist had detonated the bomb in the busy marketplace.\n\nTill now  no terror organistation has come forward to claim responsibility for the deadly bomb blast. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said that a woman was seen sitting on a bench for around 40 minutes  and left just minutes before the explosion. Two male attackers are also associated with the woman.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip addressed the media shortly after the blast  saying that the incident was a “vile attack” and that the “smell of terrorism is in the air”. He further added that the perpetrators of the attack will be found and brought to justice soon.\n\nA manager of a restaurant near where the bomb went off said he heard the explosion and saw people running. The dozens of customers inside his restaurant  including women and children  panicked and screamed.\n\nThe manager  who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation  said he closed his restaurant's shutters  fearing there might be another explosion  and tried to calm the customers down.\n\nIt was reported that a government official and his young daughter were among the people who died in the explosion in Istanbul.

(Photo: Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters)\n\nThe migrant dinghy that sank in the English Channel a year ago today  leading to at least 27 lives lost  entered UK waters and sparked a search effort by the British coastguard  an interim accident report has found.\n\nThe report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch has confirmed that the Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents began investigating in January this year “when it became evident that some of the events relating to this loss of life had occurred inside UK waters”.\n\nIt has also confirmed that in response to 999 calls from the dinghy  UK rescuers did attempt a search before the migrants’ bodies were found by a fishing boat on the French side of the Channel hours later.\n\n“Along with many other migrants that were transiting the Dover Strait that night  some of those on board the boat made phone calls to alert Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres ashore about their situation ” the report says.\n\n“Staff at the Dover MRCC responded to the calls for help and dispatched UK surface and air assets to search the area where the distressed migrants were assessed to be. However  nothing was found until the report from the French fishing vessel later on 24 November.”\n\nAn investigation by i in December last year used ship tracking data to show how a HM Coastguard helicopter was launched from Lydd in the early hours of that day and began a cartwheel-shaped search at around 400ft above the surface of the water.\n\nWe also showed how a Border Force cutter  HMC Valiant  headed towards the maritime border.\n\nIt was only after that story was published that the Maritime Coastguard Agency confirmed that a search had taken place after initially failing to provide confirmation.\n\nDan O’Mahoney  the Home Office’s Clandestine Threat Commander  told the Joint Committee on Human Rights on 1 December HM Coastguard received “dozens of calls” that night  with multiple boats in the water  and responded to them all.\n\n“I can’t tell you with any certainty that the people on that particular boat called the UK authorities ” he told the committee  adding that “it may never be possible to say with absolute accuracy whether that boat was in UK waters or French waters”.\n\nTom Pursglove  then a Home Office minister for tacking illegal immigration  also told the committee it was his “very clear understanding” the tragedy had occurred in French waters.\n\ni revealed exclusively in January that the MAIB had launched an investigation into the emergency response that night “on the assumption that some parts of the accident occurred in UK waters”.\n\nWe separately obtained a mobile phone image of a map the father of one of the victims claimed was sent to him by a people smuggler  claiming to show the dinghy’s location on the UK side of the Channel at 2.03am.\n\nThe MAIB  which only investigates accidents involving British ships or vessels in UK waters  had initially did not initially investigate the dinghy sinking as it did not consider that it fell within its remit.\n\nMatt Schanck  a maritime search and rescue expert who wrote a technical report for lawyers representing some of the victims  which was passed to the MAIB  prior to the investigation said today the co-ordination of the UK search was “almost non-existent”.\n\nHe said: “The release of the interim report proves our assessment from January that the boat was indeed in distress in UK waters and HM Coastguard were aware.\n\n“Despite this  the co-ordination of search and rescue efforts from the UK was almost non-existent and resulted in more than 30 people losing their lives which must be thoroughly and independently investigated.”\n\ni understands the MAIB obtained legal advice before beginning its investigation on the premise that it would cease investigating if the dinghy was found not to have entered the UK. In the last few days  this caveat was dropped from the MAIB website.\n\nMigrants’ charities have been making calls for the Government to launch a full inquiry into the sinking so the victims’ families can find out how their loved ones died.\n\nA public inquiry could consider whether “acts or omissions” by British agencies resulted in human rights breaches and contributed to the deaths.\n\nFrench investigators are examining whether there are grounds for considering criminal charges in connection with the handling off the 24 November tragedy on the other side of the Channel  according to French media reports.\n\nA report compiled by Gendarmerie Maritime – the French military maritime police force – after ten months of investigation questions whether co-ordinators at the French regional rescue co-ordination centre near Calais  known as CROSS  did enough to offer assistance to those on board the sinking inflatable  Le Monde reported.\n\nThe document  submitted to the French authorities last month  suggests that several mayday calls received from the migrants by CROSS took place when the vessel was still in French waters but no assistance was provided. In particular  the report alleges that British requests for the French to send a patrol boat  Flamant  to the area were turned down despite the Flamant being closer to the sinking migrant boat and not engaged in any other vital task at the time.\n\nThe French investigators have recommended further investigations into whether an offence of failing to provide assistance to persons in danger was committed  Le Monde said.\n\nTim Naor Hilton  Chief Executive of Refugee Action  said: “Our thoughts go out to the loved ones of the people who lost their lives in last year’s disaster – and all refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK traumatised by it.\n\n“This was an avoidable tragedy – it was a tragedy born out of a hostile Government policy that prioritises keeping people out over keeping people safe.\n\n“Deterrence will never work because a tiny minority of people fleeing war and persecution around the world will always need the UK to be a place to seek safety.\n\n“Many have powerful reasons to want to come here that we can all understand – they have family here  or friends here  or community here.\n\n“Ministers refuse to accept this reality and it’s putting more lives at risk. While leaders waste time with cruel and costly deterrence plans – such as their deportation deal with Rwanda – the lack of safe routes means more people feel than ever feel they have no other choice but to make the dangerous journey across the Channel.\n\n“It’s time for a new approach. The Government must ditch the hostility and create new ways for people to travel safely to the UK to claim asylum. Because if they don’t  the criminal people smugglers will.”\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with the families of all of those who lost their lives in the tragic incident last November.\n\n“We cannot have a repeat of this devastating event which is why we are working with our international partners to disrupt the people smuggling gangs behind these dangerous crossings who are putting lives at risk with every journey they arrange.\n\n“As is standard practice in such circumstances  the Marine Accident Investigation Branch is conducting a safety investigation focusing on the emergency response to the incident  which HM Coastguard and the Home Office are fully cooperating with.”'],provide damage inflatable dinghy lie abandon beach near calais one year one sinking kill

Movie on Rwanda reopens old wounds | The Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2007/08/10/movie_on_rwanda_reopens_old_wounds.html,"['For Rwandan President Paul Kagame  it was a step back in time as he watched a Canadian feature film about one of the saddest periods in his country\'s history – the 100 days in 1994 that saw the slaughter of between 800 000 and one million people.\n\nKagame saw the film  based on Gen. Roméo Dallaire\'s book Shake Hands with the Devil  at a special preview for about 75 people in the Rwandan capital last night. It took place at the plush Serena Hotel in downtown Kigali. On hand were government officials  including cabinet ministers  as well as the movie\'s producer Laszlo Barna and several Rwandan actors and crew.\n\n""You could hear a pin drop "" Barna said about the reaction of Rwandans as they watched the film.\n\nThe two-hour film  which depicts Dallaire\'s fight to get the world to pay attention to the genocide that took place in Rwanda that fateful spring  will have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 9.\n\nIn 1994  Kagame was the leader of an invading rebel force trying to end the genocide. A peace agreement between warring factions in Rwanda had been signed  but was on precarious ground when the plane of the then-president of Rwanda was mysteriously shot down. All aboard were killed.\n\nThis triggered 100 days of cold-blooded killing of mostly Tutsis and some moderate Hutus  capping five decades of discrimination against the Tutsis in Rwanda.\n\nBarna said it was important to him to get the movie right.\n\n""It was probably one of the most nerve-wracking screenings I\'ve ever had "" he said in a phone interview from Kigali. ""The people here lived this as a reality.\n\n""Rwandans are very circumspect about giving their real opinion ... I think the audience was very  very  very taken with the movie.""\n\nAnd so apparently was Kagame  Barna said. ""He said he liked it and complimented the film.""\n\nHe wasn\'t alone in his praise.\n\n""It shows how the international community abandoned Dallaire and Rwanda "" Joseph Habineza  Rwanda\'s minister of youth  culture and sports  told the Star in a telephone interview.\n\nHabineza said Kagame – surrounded by bodyguards and a crush of admirers – told local reporters after the screening that the movie reminded him only too vividly of the sorrow the Rwandan people went through.\n\nAnd it wasn\'t just politicians who were moved. Barna said many others in the audience told him after the screening they were disturbed and shaken by reliving the events portrayed in the movie.\n\nShot in Rwanda  Shake Hands with the Devil stars Canadian actor Roy Dupuis as the retired Canadian general. It tracks Dallaire\'s experiences in the central African country as he tried to lead a UN mission to help Rwandans restore peace. Instead  he found himself trying to alert the international community and the United Nations that thousands of people were being rounded up and routinely murdered. He was thwarted on all fronts.\n\nTen members of his own UN force were killed and Dallaire was eventually ordered home  but he defied the order and continued to try to bring international attention to the plight of Tutsis and moderate Hutus who were being slaughtered.\n\nCivilians were rounded up in their homes and killed.

Nine dead in Russia school shooting - Rwanda Today,https://rwandatoday.africa/rwanda/news/nine-dead-in-russia-school-shooting-3397672,"['The country\'s FSB security service says it has prevented dozens of armed attacks on schools in recent years.\n\nIn October 2018  a teenage gunman killed 20 people at the Kerch technical college in Crimea  the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nBy AFP More by this Author\n\nAt least nine people  most of them children  were killed Tuesday when a lone teenage gunman opened fire at a school in the central Russian city of Kazan  officials said.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin ordered a review of gun control laws after the shooting - one of the worst in recent Russian history - which occurred on the first day back to school following annual May holidays.\n\nThe spree started around 9:30 local time (630 GMT)  sparking panic among students and teachers at the School No. 175 in Kazan  the capital of the Russian predominantly Muslim republic of Tatarstan.\n\nAmateur footage on social media  apparently filmed from a nearby building  showed people escaping from the school by jumping from second- and third-floor windows  with sounds of gunshots echoing in the schoolyard.\n\nPolice said they detained the gunman approximately one hour after initial reports of shooting.\n\nSeven of the dead were children in the eighth grade  Tatarstan regional leader Rustam Minnikhanov told reporters.

Tanzania gun attack: Five things we know so far - Rwanda Today,https://rwandatoday.africa/rwanda/news/tanzania-gun-attack-five-things-we-know-so-far-3525042,"['By The Citizen Reporter More by this Author\n\nDar es Salaam \n\nA daring daytime attack in Dar es Salaam  Tanzania has left four people dead.\n\nWhile details are still scanty  here is what we know so far:\n\n1. The shooting was carried out by a lone gunman at around midday along Ali Hassan Mwinyi Road near the French Embassy. The incident happened at the junction between Kenyatta Road and Kinondoni.\n\n2. Police have confirmed that four are dead including the shooter and three police officers. Tanzanian authorities also say that six others were injured in the incident that involved a lone gunman on the usually calm section of the Commercial capital.\n\n""As you can see in that circulating short video clips on social media but our police officers managed to shoot him down  he was holding an SMG ” Inspector General of Police  Simon Sirro  said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.

He then started shooting in the air  forcing people nearby to run for cover.\n\n4. According to Tanzania\'s head of police operations  Liberatus Sabas  the incident is not terror-related as many observers have speculated on social media.\n\nHowever  IG Sirro had earlier hinted at the possibility that the attack could be linked to the insurgency in Northern Mozambique where joint SADC forces are battling jihadists.

"Questions on gun control arise after police, soldiers seemingly go on a ...",https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rwanda-today/news/questions-on-gun-control-arise-after-police-soldiers-seemingly-go-on-a-shooting-spree--1329392,['Recent cases of fatal shootings involving police officers and soldiers have ignited concerns that the Rwandan armed forces are increasingly becoming trigger-happy. This has also raised questions on gun controls within the Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF) and Rwanda National Police (RNP).\n\nThis year alone  more than 10 cases of such shootings have claimed close to a dozen lives. Only recently  on October 17  a policeman shot dead a person in the busy Nyabugogo area of Kigali. Vedaste Niyomugabo alias Nyinya had allegedly confronted the officer as he tried to apprehend a vendor.\n\nCity of Kigali police spokesperson Supt Modeste Mbabazi said Niyomugabo attempted to disarm the policeman  forcing the officer to shoot him.\n\n“Niyomugabo found a police officer doing his job of ensuring law and order ” Supt Mbabazi said. “The policeman had arrested a suspect in wrongdoing and  as he was handcuffing her  the deceased attempted to free the woman.\n\n“He hit the policeman with a chair and then pushed him to the ground. He then tried to grab the gun and  in the scuffle  the officer got hold of the gun and shot him twice. Unfortunately  he died. “It should however be noted that this was done in self-defence.”\n\nThe officer  only identified as Cpl Nduwayezu  was reportedly injured. He will not face any charges or disciplinary action  according to the police citing the law on self-defence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Penal Code removes criminal liability from a law enforcement officer who shoots in self-defence and  according to eyewitnesses  Niyomugabo  a demobilised Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF) soldier  had overpowered the police officer.\n\n“The law is very clear: If anyone threatens with violence an officer doing his or her job to the extent of trying to disarm them  they act in self-defence because they are protected by law ” said Supt Mbabazi  saying the police officers keep high levels of discipline and proportionality of force in their own defence.\n\nOn May 6  another policeman shot a suspected thug commonly known as Kirabura K-Swiss. This was after the victim allegedly attempted to snatch an item from a car as the driver waited at the traffic lights near Centenary House.\n\nAfter a short chase by police officers at the scene  a policeman stationed at Bank of Kigali tried to stop Kirabura. The officer then cocked his gun but Kirabura did stop  prompting him to shoot the fleeing suspect. Kirabura reportedly died as he was being taken to hospital.\n\nOn June 15  police shot and killed a man as he attempted to escape from lawful custody. Eric Hashakimana  26  was a suspect in the poisoning of senior RDF officers in the Northern Province town of Gicumbi.\n\nRNP Spokesperson ACP Damas Gatare said the police regretted the incident in which the bartender  who had confessed to security agents over the incident  was killed.\n\nDrunken quarrel\n\n“On June 15 at about 10am  while on the way to the scene of investigation in Rukomo business centre  Nyamiyaga Cell of Kageyo Sector  Hashakimana jumped off the vehicle as he tried to escape  forcing the police to shoot ” ACP Gatare said in a statement after the shooting.\n\nIn February in Musambira Sector  Kamonyi District  a policeman shot and killed two soldiers following a drunken quarrel.\n\nAn RDF private  Théogene Munyembabazi  shot and killed five people and injured seven in a night club in Gicumbi District on August 10. The soldier got agitated following a misunderstanding in the bar  returned to the barracks and picked his gun. He returned to the bar and shot randomly at revellers.\n\nIn a statement  the RDF “deeply regretted” and “strongly condemned” the killing and injuring of innocent people. Maj René Ngendahimana  the Deputy Defence and Military Spokesperson  then said the criminal act violated RDF’s “well known ethos and discipline.”\n\nOn October 6  Munyembabazi was jailed for life and ordered to pay more than Rwf80 million to the aggrieved families as restitution. Just days after the Gicumbi shooting  on September 22  another soldier shot and killed a person and critically injured another  also in a bar  in the Western Province town of Rubavu.\n\nThe soldier was reportedly angered by a prostitute who stole Rwf200 000 from his pocket when he stepped out. He walked to a nearby barracks  picked a gun and returned to the bar  where he opened fire  killing Jean Claude Niyoyita on the spot.\n\nThe two incidents raised questions on the ease with which off-duty soldiers and policemen access guns  even though both police and the military maintain there are strict rules on how guns and stored and given out.\n\nPie Habimana  a lawyer and legal analyst  said although the concept of self-defence is likely to be abused  the Nyabugogo case seems justified  going by the police version of the story. He said that  if indeed the policeman was overpowered by the attacker and was on the verge of losing his gun on the job  there was a high likelihood of his life being in danger.\n\nMr Habimana however said that  going by the cases of fatal shootings involving police and suspects  there is a possibility of the principle of self-defence being abused. He said self-defence works on the principle that the reaction must be proportional to the degree of force with which one is threatened or attacked.\n\n“A non-deadly threat may only be countered with a non-deadly defence ” he said. “A threat capable of causing death or grave bodily may be met with deadly force but we have had cases where suspects are shot upon slight resistance.\n\n“We also have cases where someone is not armed with a gun or any other dangerous object but they are shot in dangerous places that can cause death at the mere attempt to run away. I think the police and the army are not trained to use only a gun. They should use other tactics as shooting comes as the last option.”\n\nEfforts to reach Military of Defence Spokesperson Brig-Gen Joseph Nzabamwita on this matter were futile by press time.'],recent case fatal shooting involve police officer soldier ignite concern rwandan arm force increasingly become trigger happy also raise question gun control within rwanda defence force rdf rwanda national police rnp n nthis year alone case shooting claim close dozen life recently october policeman shot dead person busy nyabugogo area kigali vedaste niyomugabo alias nyinya allegedly confront officer try apprehend vendor n ncity kigali police spokesperson supt modeste mbabazi say niyomugabo attempt disarm policeman force officer shoot n nniyomugabo find police officer job ensure law order supt mbabazi say policeman arrest suspect wrongdoing handcuff decease attempted free woman n nhe hit policeman chair push ground try grab gun scuffle officer get hold gun shot twice unfortunately die however note do self defence n nthe officer identify cpl nduwayezu reportedly injure face charge disciplinary action accord police cite law self defence n nadvertisement n nthe penal code remove criminal liability law enforcement officer shoot self defence accord eyewitness niyomugabo demobilise rwanda defence force rdf soldier overpowered police officer n nthe law clear anyone threaten violence officer job extent try disarm act self defence protect law say supt mbabazi say police officer keep high level discipline proportionality force defence n non may another policeman shot suspect thug commonly know kirabura k swiss victim allegedly attempt snatch item car driver wait traffic light near centenary house n nafter short chase police officer scene policeman station bank kigali try stop kirabura officer cock gun kirabura stop prompt shoot flee suspect kirabura reportedly die take hospital n non june police shot kill man attempt escape lawful custody eric hashakimana suspect poison senior rdf officer northern province town gicumbi n nrnp spokesperson acp dama gatare say police regret incident bartender confess security agent incident kill n ndrunken quarrel n non june way scene investigation rukomo business centre nyamiyaga cell kageyo sector hashakimana jump vehicle tried escape force police shoot acp gatare say statement shoot n nin february musambira sector kamonyi district policeman shot kill two soldier follow drunken quarrel n nan rdf private théogene munyembabazi shot kill five people injured seven night club gicumbi district august soldier get agitate follow misunderstand bar return barrack pick gun return bar shot randomly reveller n nin statement rdf deeply regret strongly condemn kill injure innocent people maj rené ngendahimana deputy defence military spokesperson say criminal act violate rdfs well know ethos discipline n non october munyembabazi jail life order pay rwf million aggrieved family restitution day gicumbi shoot september another soldier shot kill person critically injure another also bar western province town rubavu n nthe soldier reportedly anger prostitute stole rwf pocket step walk nearby barrack pick gun return bar open fire kill jean claude niyoyita spot n nthe two incident raise question ease duty soldier policemen access gun even though police military maintain strict rule gun store give n npie habimana lawyer legal analyst say although concept self defence likely abuse nyabugogo case seem justified go police version story say indeed policeman overpower attacker verge lose gun job high likelihood life danger n nmr habimana however say go case fatal shooting involve police suspect possibility principle self defence abuse say self defence work principle reaction must proportional degree force one threaten attack n na non deadly threat may counter non deadly defence say threat capable cause death grave bodily may meet deadly force case suspect shot upon slight resistance n nwe also case someone arm gun dangerous object shot dangerous place cause death mere attempt run away think police army train use gun use tactic shoot come last option n nefforts reach military defence spokesperson brig gen joseph nzabamwita matter futile press time,0.5874266834519618,1

We have to kill Tutsis wherever they are | Democratic Republic of the ...,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/16/congo.rwanda,"['The following correction was printed in the Guardian\'s Corrections and clarifications column  Monday May 26 2008\n\nThe article below  about child soldiers being trained by the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)  a group run by Hutu extremists in the Democratic Republic of Congo  said that Callixte Nzabonimana  one of the FDLR\'s leaders and a former Rwandan minister of youth and sport  is wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in connection with the Rwandan genocide in 1994. In fact Nzabonimana was arrested in February this year in Tanzania.\n\nThe boy with the shaved head and Kalashnikov slung across his legs is uncertain about a lot of things  even his age. He pulls at the long  dry grass around him and in a quiet voice says he thinks that he might be 13 years old because he was a baby when his mother wrapped him with the last of her possessions and made her escape across the border. Asked where he is from  he gestures toward the lush hills rippling to the east. Somewhere among them is an unmarked frontier with a country the boy calls home  although he has no memory of the last time he was there.\n\nWhat\'s over the hills? Rwanda  he says. Where are his parents? He doesn\'t know. Dead  he thinks. He doesn\'t remember them  only what some people told him.\n\nAnd what was he told? He was very small when everyone ran away from those they called the inyenzi - the cockroaches. His mother carried him across the border  out of Rwanda. But then something happened to her. Perhaps she was among the multitudes who died then or in the ensuing years; he was left alone and the other people in the refugee camp looked after him. His father was a soldier. He just disappeared. No one said anything about him.\n\nThat was in 1994 and the boy has been on the move ever since  tramping from one part of the Democratic Republic of Congo to another  growing up as part of a caravan of killers and their families who  for a long time  dared not stay still if they wanted to survive  until he came full circle to the place where he was separated from his mother.\n\nHe falls silent again for a while  watching Congolese villagers who live in fear of children such as him. Then he begins to speak about what he does know. It is the Tutsis  those inyenzi  who are to blame for his predicament  he says  and he must kill them. He hates them all. They stole his country  Rwanda - a Hutu country  he calls it - and he wants them dead.\n\nThere is an innocence to the boy\'s face for all the hardships he has endured  but there is something in his voice with that word  inyenzi. A sharpness  perhaps out of contempt or perhaps knowing its power to conjure up the horror of the murder of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 by men who branded them ""cockroaches"". Soon afterwards  when Tutsi rebels defeated the killers and took over Rwanda\'s government  the Hutu exodus began and the boy\'s life changed irrevocably.\n\nChild soldiers can be found across Africa. Sometimes they are responsible for appalling atrocities; sometimes it is because their minds have been twisted by powerful drugs. But nowhere on the continent are they as driven by hate and ideology as among the Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Congo. Here  after more than a decade of invasion  civil war and slaughter - rooted in the genocide - a second generation of killers is being imbued with the mind-altering ideology of extermination and reared to hate and murder Tutsis.\n\nSome of the children learn it from fathers who were responsible for the mass killings the first time around  back in Rwanda. Others  like the boy  are raised by the extremist Hutu rebels who control large areas of eastern Congo and are among the most important causes of the conflict there that has claimed an estimated five million lives or more over the past decade and continues to kill about 45 000 people each month in Congo through the effects of war - principally starvation and disease.\n\nThese children are led by men with multimillion-dollar rewards on their heads offered by the United States for their capture to stand trial accused of the murder of thousands in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. America has listed their armed group  the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)  as a terrorist organisation  but some of its political leaders have found safe haven in Europe. And while their army is fighting  the leadership is raking in millions through the smuggling of gold and diamonds  and extortion.\n\nThe boy is sitting alone  guarding the perimeter of an FDLR camp that is a bone-shaking six-hour drive into the mountains south of the Congolese city of Bukavu on unmade roads that wind along the border with Rwanda and then veer in country. The Congolese government has almost no influence in these parts. Its forces rarely venture into the surrounding hills and the FDLR lives off the local people - plundering and sometimes raping and killing.\n\nThe camp is little more than a dozen or so mud brick and wood huts with grass roofs.\n\nA handful of soldiers sit around. Some wear the same uniforms as government troops - plain olive green  with black boots or wellingtons. Others sport brightly coloured T-shirts with slogans promoting various beers. They carry Kalashnikovs and a couple of larger-calibre weapons with belts of bullets slung across shoulders. There is a weak attempt at camouflage with grass stuck into baseball caps  but the camp is isolated on the side of a hill  not visible from the approach road and easy to protect. No one comes after the FDLR here  but there is a rusting rim of an old car wheel dangling from a nearby tree as an alarm. The boy is supposed to beat it as hard as he can if the enemy approaches.\n\nHe looks to be the youngest fighter here - most of the others are in their late teens or 20s although one man with a large paunch seems out of place. A couple have weak moustaches  others shaved heads.\n\nThey are all members of the FDLR\'s armed wing  known within the organisation as the ""Army of Jesus"". The religious undertones run deep. One of the group\'s operations against Rwanda was codenamed ""Oracle of the Lord"".\n\nThe FDLR boasts about 7 000 fighters  hundreds of them children or youths  and is the largest of the militias in eastern Congo.\n\nIt controls about one-fifth of the two vast provinces that border Rwanda - North and South Kivu - but its influence ranges considerably further as it hunts down Tutsis who live in Congo  and continues to threaten nearby Rwanda.\n\nThe boy  with his straightforward beliefs  sees no reason not to say aloud that the path to a better life lies over the graves of Tutsis. It is a philosophy based on the ""Hutu 10 Commandments"" that underpinned the genocide. The commandments call any Hutu who marries a Tutsi a traitor  and say that the Tutsis\' ""only goal is ethnic superiority"".\n\n""Hutu must stop taking pity on the Tutsi "" says the eighth commandment.\n\n""Hutu must stand firm and vigilant against their common enemy: the Tutsi "" says the ninth.\n\nJerubaal Kayiranga fought with the FDLR. One of his responsibilities was to recruit children to its ranks  many of them forcibly  before he fled back to Rwanda last year. In a demobilisation camp there he describes how the philosophy of the Hutu 10 Commandments lives on in the hills of eastern Congo and how some of its most enthusiastic adherents are the FDLR\'s youngest fighters. In the Congo fighting  ""many FDLR soldiers died  so that\'s why these boys are recruited at 10 years old to fight "" he says. ""They\'re worse than the older ones because they don\'t even know how Rwanda is. They don\'t know any Tutsis. They just hate them as the enemy. It\'s the same as they [extreme Hutu leaders] were telling us during the genocide. They told us what we should do is kill all the Tutsis in the country.""\n\nThat is exactly how the boy sees things.\n\n""The Tutsis stole our country and they are killing the Hutus or making them slaves. We have to kill them wherever they are. It is the only way to get our country back. When they are defeated I can go home "" he says. ""It\'s not hard to kill. You shoot.""\n\nA Hutu rebel commander wants to meet in the market of a Congolese village called Sange near the border with Rwanda. Arriving with a handful of his troops  Colonel Edmond Ngarambe sits on a wooden bench in the shade of a tree. His soldiers scatter to guard his back. I remark on how some look to be in their teens.\n\n""Most of our new recruits came from Rwanda as children "" he says. ""They are fighting to take their country back.""\n\nNgarambe is in Sange to persuade me that the FDLR is not what it seems. It\'s true that its website describes the present Tutsi-led government in Rwanda as fascist  bloodthirsty  arrogant and barbaric. It also  in an interesting about-face from reality  says the Tutsis are seeking to exterminate the Hutus.\n\nBut Ngarambe  who served as a lieutenant in the army of Rwanda\'s former Hutu government  which led the genocide  says that is not the full picture. The FDLR is much misunderstood  he argues  and is merely seeking democracy and justice. That  it turns out  means a return to the Hutu domination that underpinned the 1994 genocide and an end to the trials of those indicted for mass murder.\n\nBut then  Ngarambe sees himself as a victim in his self-imposed exile.\n\nCountless extremist militiamen and soldiers joined the million Hutu refugees - the boy and his mother among them - who  in July 1994  struggled from Rwanda into what was then Zaire (the country changed its name to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1997) fleeing the consequences of genocide. Their arrival set in motion a cycle of civil war and invasions that engulfed eastern Congo  as foreign armies  rebel groups  warlords and militias rooted in mystical tradition carved up the region.\n\nNo one knows how many died here but the most widely accepted estimate is of more than five million  mostly from disease and starvation  although massacres were commonplace enough that mass graves are still being unearthed. The living suffered too  enduring the rape of entire towns and villages. Through it all  the broken  defeated but unrepentant murderers from Rwanda carried their ideology of hate. The old organisations that led the genocide - the notorious interahamwe militia and Hutu army - gave way to new groups that then emerged as the FDLR.\n\nBut the boys in the hills are mostly too young to remember all that. They are sullen and avoid eye contact. There are no smiles and few hints of a child under the skin. It is hard to say what kind of killing these children have seen or are responsible for  but for many it is probably their most formative experience.\n\nThey are like the boys with guns coerced into fighting in other parts of Africa  battle-hardened by acting as porters  carrying weapons and food to get them used to the sound of gunfire and death. In time they are drawn into the killing  perhaps made to perform some atrocity not only to harden them but to implicate them so that there is no turning back.\n\nWith it they learn a terrible lesson: that a gun will get them what they want - food  money  sex. They also believe it will get them back to Rwanda. But if they ever do get there  they will discover  like the former child soldiers of Liberia  Sierra Leone and Uganda  that it is not easy to return to what passes for a normal life.\n\nNgarambe sees none of that. He says children are drawn into the FDLR\'s ranks because of a burning sense of injustice. ""Schoolboys are coming to us. They are fighting to be free. We do not have to indoctrinate them. They come to us because they know who the enemy is. They do not want to be slaves "" he says.\n\nBut they are so young.\n\n""It doesn\'t matter how young they are if they don\'t have their freedom. They will not be free so long as the Tutsis control Rwanda.""\n\nFourteen-year-old Bahati Mugisha doesn\'t put it that way. He is a young FDLR fighter who was captured by the group\'s principal enemy inside Congo - a renegade Tutsi general  Laurent Nkunda  who broke from the Congolese government army to battle the Hutu rebels who were killing and ethnically cleansing Congo\'s own Tutsi population of several hundred thousand.\n\n""They gave me a gun and said we were going to fight the Tutsis "" says the teenager. ""They said these were our enemy and we must kill as many as possible."" Asked who told him these things  the teenager says his commander - men such as Aloize Mbanza  a 53-year-old former Rwandan army corporal who found himself indoctrinating a new Hutu generation in Congo. Mbanza fled back to his homeland last year. ""Most of the FDLR who are young came from Rwanda when they were very small  so they grew up in Congo "" he says. ""Now the FDLR is also recruiting Rwandan boys who were born in Congo  in the refugee camps. They are 12 or 13 years old. They are the ones who don\'t have fear. They are fighting with guns. There are many of them. The only school they know is the army.""\n\nThey are also dying.\n\n""There were other boys fighting with me "" says Mugisha. ""I know some of them died. I saw two who died  killed there in the battles. But there were others  too. Some of the other boys were younger than me.""\n\nOthers have been killed trying to escape the FDLR\'s clutches. Former rebels such as Mbanza and Kayiranga are lucky to have got away. ""If our chiefs thought we were going back to Rwanda  they would take you and kill you "" says Kayiranga. ""I saw Colonel Haguma killed because he wanted to come back. They beat him and he died. I know a sergeant who was hanged from a tree because he had the idea to come back. They call a meeting and they point at you and say you want to go back to the Tutsi government and then they kill you. Sometimes they kill you by hitting your head with a hammer. They have many ways.""\n\nA number of the FDLR\'s leadership were heavily involved in the Rwandan genocide. They include some who are wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda  which was set up by the UN Security Council to try those responsible for the massacres in Rwanda  and two men who are also on the US government\'s ""most wanted"" list of those it wants to see captured and handed over to the tribunal.\n\nAmong the wanted FDLR leaders is Callixte Nzabonimana  the Rwandan minister of youth and sport during the genocide who  according to an international tribunal indictment  ""played a major role in the massacres of the Tutsis in Gitarama. He visited the bourgmestres [mayors] frequently to organise the massacres in their communes with them. Further  he personally travelled through the hills along with peasant farmers to be certain the farmers were carrying out properly their orders to kill the Tutsis"". The US has offered a $5m (£2.5m) reward for his capture to be put on trial by the tribunal.\n\nThe tribunal has named another FDLR leader  Ildephonse Nizeyimana  as among its six most wanted. He headed military intelligence operations in southern Rwanda and set up special units of soldiers that led massacres at the country\'s main university. He also gave the order for soldiers to surround a school as the interahamwe murdered 1 300 children and adults. The US is also offering a reward for Nizeyimana\'s capture.\n\nThe FDLR\'s overall military commander  Major General Sylvestre Mudacumura  is wanted by the Rwandan government to face trial for his role as deputy commander of the presidential guard which flew across the country to begin the mass murder in April 1994. Today he is a primary mover behind the killing of Congo\'s Tutsis. He is also under investigation by the international tribunal.\n\nAmong others listed as ""most wanted"" by the Rwandan government is an FDLR colonel  Faustin Sebuhura  who  as a captain in the Hutu army  oversaw the massacre of about 50 000 Tutsis  and Déogratias Hategekimana  who  as a mayor  coordinated the killing of 65 000 people.\n\nThe FDLR\'s political leadership is less directly implicated in the genocide but is wanted in the Rwandan capital  Kigali  for atrocities against civilians by the rebel group. While their organisation is also officially listed as a terrorist group by the US government  the rebels\' political chief  Ignace Murwanashyaka  lives largely untroubled in Bonn  Germany. His deputy  Musoni Straton  is in Brussels. The FDLR also maintains some presence through representatives in other parts of Europe - France  Switzerland  Holland - and in South Africa  Canada and the US.\n\nTalking now under the tree in Sange market  Ngarambe is evasive about his own part in the tragedy of 1994. He was a Hutu army officer at the time. He denies the genocide was planned  even though the international tribunal for Rwanda has established that there was an extensive conspiracy at the highest political and military levels of the Hutu regime to exterminate the entire Tutsi population.\n\n""If they say the genocide was organised  it\'s not true. It was civil war. It was something that happened suddenly. It wasn\'t planned "" he says. ""Ever since I was young  I didn\'t know how to hate a Tutsi. I lived in a place with many Tutsis. My friends were Tutsis. Even in the army there was not teaching of hatred of Tutsis.""\n\nBut most of those Tutsi friends and neighbours are dead. It takes a while for Ngarambe to reveal that his own father is blamed for some of their killings. He is 75 years old and in a Rwandan prison awaiting trial for genocide.\n\nHis mother and sister were locked up for a while  too  by Rwanda\'s present Tutsi-led government. ""They said they took part in the genocide. My father\'s only an old guy. My sister was killed by the army when she tried to escape in 1997. The army killed my other sister when they came looking for my father to arrest him "" he says.\n\nIn Sange market  the Congolese traders eye Ngarambe and his men warily. It is only after the FDLR officer has left that one or two will talk. ""We fear those men "" says a small woman in a yellow wrap selling vegetables from a basket. ""They use their guns to take our food and money. They do not leave us enough food for our own families but we cannot say anything because they will kill us. There is no law here."" Others in the market decide it is wiser not to speak.\n\nNgarambe concedes that his men take from the local people. ""When there\'s a war  that\'s when there\'s difficulties. We are obliged to take food from the population when there\'s fighting. But when we stay somewhere for six months  we try to farm "" he says. ""Our relations with the local population are extremely good. They understand our problems. They understand we will one day go back to Rwanda.""\n\nIn some places  Hutu refugees have built their own villages  including schools and health centres staffed by Rwandan teachers  doctors and nurses. In others  they have moved into Congolese villages  sometimes usurping the authority of traditional chiefs and taking over administrative positions in local government. Often they plunder crops - Congolese villagers have a saying about the FDLR: ""We cultivate and they harvest"" - and by extorting ""taxes"" from just about anyone  from market stall holders and farmers to transport companies and butcheries  and ""tolls"" to cross rivers and bridges. The FDLR also grows and sells significant amounts of marijuana.\n\nMuch of the FDLR\'S money goes to buy weapons and to run the training camps  which include infantry and artillery schools  and one for the rebels\' commando unit that goes by the acronym CRAP. But there is worse than plunder. Systematic rape of hundreds of thousands of women has been a hallmark of the conflict in eastern Congo  and the FDLR is not the only group involved. In South Kivu alone  tens of thousands of women have been treated in health clinics after being raped  and many more will have gone untreated.\n\nNgarambe admits that some of his men are responsible but says everyone is at it  including a group known as the Rastas  made up of deserters from the notorious Mai-Mai militia  the Congolese army and the FDLR. ""This thing of rape - I can\'t deny that happens. We are human beings. But it\'s not just us "" he says.\n\nWhile the rank and file of the FDLR survives by plundering  their leaders are involved in altogether more lucrative ventures. A 2007 World Bank-funded study estimates that the FDLR leadership makes millions of dollars a\n\nyear from taking over mines in parts of North Kivu  such as Masisi and Walikale  or from those doing the hard labour through levying ""taxes"" of gold  coltan  diamonds and other minerals on mine owners.\n\nThe study estimates that the FDLR controls half of the mineral trade in the Kivus outside of the main towns  and oversees the smuggling of gold and diamonds for sale in neighbouring countries such as Uganda and Burundi. It is not alone in this. The Rwandan  Ugandan and Burundi armies  as well as warlords and militias  have also carved up the mineral plunder and smuggling rackets.\n\nThe poison against Tutsis has spread beyond the Hutu exile population and infected many ordinary Congolese  largely driven by anger at the invasions of Congo by Rwanda\'s Tutsi-led government and at the actions of the renegade general Nkunda  who says he is fighting to protect Congo\'s Tutsis from the FDLR. Many Congolese believe that Nkunda  aged 40 and a former intelligence officer in the Rwandan army  is still secretly serving the Rwandan government. Hundreds of thousands of Congolese have been driven from their homes in Nkunda\'s attacks; his forces are guilty of mass rape and he too has forcibly recruited children to fight.\n\nFrom his headquarters in a colonial-era house in the hills around Masisi in North Kivu  Nkunda says he is an effect  not a cause  of Congo\'s continued upheaval: ""It\'s as if you can kill Tutsis and no one cares "" he says. ""I am here to protect them and I won\'t stop until the FDLR is gone  finished. We cannot allow it to take over North and South Kivu or all the Tutsis will be finished.\n\n""They say I\'m the problem. But who is killing who? I am defending the Tutsis who live here from the people who committed genocide in Rwanda ... Remove the FDLR and you remove the need for me to fight.""\n\nMany Tutsis see Nkunda as their only means of protection. Many Congolese see the Tutsis as the problem. Anti-Tutsi vitriol can be heard from Congo\'s leaders down to the residents of eastern towns such as Goma. Congolese politicians have called on people to ""exterminate the vermin""  meaning Tutsis. Amid such entrenched hatred  the future for the boy in the oversize uniform is bleak. Colonel Ngarambe has three children of his own now  the eldest just eight years old  all born in exile. He would like to see them settled in Rwanda but only on the terms he has in mind - a Rwanda where politics is defined by ethnic domination and the Tutsis recognise the rule of the Hutu majority. If not  Ngarambe says his children will carry on the fight.\n\n""The children born here are FDLR "" he says. ""The children born in Rwanda will be FDLR. My children will be FDLR.\n\n""The conflict between Hutu and Tutsi is based on power. It\'s not that we have to develop an ideology of hatred against the Tutsis. It\'s just that people should see what\'s happening. Just because the Tutsis were victim of a genocide doesn\'t give them the right to take power.""']",follow correction print guardian correction clarification column monday may n nthe article child

They shot at him and he died ” he told Reuters by phone on Saturday.\n\n“After that they moved to another nearby house and also shot another person ” he said  adding that three of the unidentified gunmen wore either police or army uniforms.\n\nWhile it was not immediately clear who the gunmen were  activists and authorities have in the past reported a number of apparently targeted killings.\n\nNearly quarter of a million people have fled the violence in Burundi  with more than 70 000 seeking refuge in neighboring Rwanda  according to the U.N. refugee agency.\n\nBurundi accused Rwanda in December of supporting a rebel group that was recruiting Burundian refugees on Rwandan soil  a charge dismissed by Rwandan President Paul Kagame.\n\nA confidential report to the U.N.

Rwandan woman who had hand chopped off and baby killed during genocide ...,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2598149/Rwandan-woman-hand-chopped-baby-killed-genocide-20-years-ago-FRIENDS-man-did-it.html,"[""Rwandan woman who had hand chopped off and baby killed during genocide 20 years ago now FRIENDS with the man who did it\n\nTutsi Alice Mukarurinda's hand was amputated and her baby was killed by Emmanuel Ndayisaba  a Hutu  in 1994\n\n\n\nOn Monday Rwanda marks the 20th anniversary of the beginning of 100 days of bloody mayhem\n\nHutus resented Tutsis for their greater wealth and what they saw as oppressive rule\n\nEmmanuel turned himself in and confessed for his crimes in 1996\n\nPrison term lasted from 1997 until 2003  when Hutus who admitted their guilt were pardoned\n\n\n\nEmmanuel and Alice live near each other and shop at the same market\n\nEmmanuel kneeled before Alice and asked for forgiveness -- and after two weeks of thought she said yes\n\nShe lost her baby daughter and her right hand to a manic killing spree. He wielded the machete that took both.\n\n\n\nYet today  despite coming from opposite sides of an unspeakable shared past  Alice Mukarurinda and Emmanuel Ndayisaba are friends. She is the treasurer and he the vice president of a group that builds simple brick houses for genocide survivors. They live near each other and shop at the same market.\n\n\n\nTheir story of ethnic violence  extreme guilt and  to some degree  reconciliation is the story of Rwanda today  20 years after its Hutu majority killed more than 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Rwandan government is still accused by human rights groups of holding an iron grip on power  stifling dissent and killing political opponents. But even critics give President Paul Kagame credit for leading the country toward a peace that seemed all but impossible two decades ago.\n\nIn this March 2014 photo  Emmanuel Ndayisaba  right  and Alice Mukarurinda  left pose for a photograph outside of her house. In 1994 Edward sliced off her hand and killed her baby girl\n\nAlice and Emmanuel  pictured  live near each other and shop at the same market\n\n'Whenever I look at my arm I remember what happened ' said Alice  a mother of five with a deep scar on her left temple where Emanuel sliced her with a machete. As she speaks  Emmanuel - the man who killed her baby - sits close enough that his left hand and her right stump sometimes touch.\n\n\n\nOn Monday  Rwanda marks the 20th anniversary of the beginning of 100 days of bloody mayhem. But the genocide was really in the making for decades  fueled by hate speech  discrimination  propaganda and the training of death squads. Hutus had come to resent Tutsis for their greater wealth and what they saw as oppressive rule.\n\n\n\nRwanda is the most densely populated country in mainland Africa  slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland but with a population of more than 12 million. The countryside is lush green  filled with uncountable numbers of banana trees.\n\n\n\nThe Hutu-Tutsi divide may be the country's most notorious characteristic but also its most confounding. The two groups are so closely related that it's nearly impossible for an outsider to tell which the average Rwandan belongs to. Even Rwandans have trouble knowing who is who  especially after two decades of a government push to create a single Rwandan identity.\n\nFor Alice  a Tutsi  the genocide began in 1992  when her family took refuge in a church for a week. Hutu community leaders began importing machetes. Houses were burned  cars taken.\n\nHutu leaders created lists of prominent or educated Tutsis targeted for killing. They also held meetings where they told those in attendance how evil the Tutsis were. Like many of his Hutu neighbors  Emmanuel soaked in the message.\n\n\n\nThe situation caught fire on April 6  1994  when the plane carrying Rwanda's president was shot down. Hutus started killing Tutsis  who ran for their lives and flooded Alice's village.\n\n\n\nThree days later  local Hutu leaders told Emmanuel  then 23  that they had a job for him.\n\nEmmanuel severed Alice's right hand and sliced her face\n\nEmmanuel turned himself in and confessed to his crimes in 1996  and his prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003\n\nThey took him to a Tutsi home and ordered him to use his machete. A Christian who sang in his church choir  Emmanuel had never killed before. But inside this house he murdered 14 people. The next day  April 12  Emmanuel found a Tutsi doctor in hiding and killed him  too. The day after  he killed two women and a child.\n\n\n\n'The very first family I killed  I felt bad  but then I got used to it ' he says. 'Given how we were told that the Tutsis were evil  after the first family I just felt like I was killing our enemies.'\n\n\n\nIn the meantime  Alice's family took refuge in a church  just as they had done before  crammed in with hundreds of others. But this time  Hutu attackers threw a bomb inside and set the church on fire. Those who fled the fire inside died by machetes outside. Alice lost some 26 family members  among the estimated 5 000 victims at the church.\n\n\n\nAlice  then 25  escaped with her 9-month-old daughter and a 9-year-old niece into Rwanda's green countryside  moving  hiding  moving. She hid in a forested swamp.\n\n\n\n'There were so many bodies all over the place ' she says. 'Hutus would wake up in the morning and go hunting for Tutsis to kill.'\n\n\n\nBy late April rebel Tutsi fighters led by Kagame had reached the capital and chased Hutus out. Hutu troops began to flee to neighboring countries  and the violence spread  with killings carried out by both sides.\n\n\n\nOn April 29  Emmanuel joined Hutu soldiers searching the countryside for Tutsis. The attackers blew a whistle whenever they found a Tutsi hiding.\n\n\n\nThe murders began at 10 a.m. and lasted until 3 p.m. Alice had been hiding in a swamp for days  keeping out only the top of her face so she could breathe. That was where the Hutus found her.\n\n\n\nThey surrounded the swamp. Then they attacked.\n\nAfter she was attacked  Alice was left for dead  fell unconscious and was found three days later by other survivors\n\nEmmanuel recognized Alice at a group for both genocide killers and survivors  who still meet weekly. Though he first avoided her  Emmanuel eventually kneeled before Alice to ask for forgiveness\n\nFirst they killed the girls. When that was done  they came after Alice. She was sure she would die  but instinctively put up her arm up to defend herself.\n\n\n\nEmmanuel  Alice's school mate  recognized the woman but couldn't recall her name. Perhaps that made it easier to rain down machete blows on Alice's right arm  severing it just above the wrist. He sliced her face. His colleague pierced a spear through her left shoulder.\n\n\n\nThey left her for dead.\n\n\n\nShe was bloodied  scarred  and missing a hand  yes  but not dead. Alice fell unconscious  she says  and was found three days later by other survivors. It was only then that she realized she no longer had a right hand.\n\n\n\nIn the months after the genocide  guilt gnawed away at Emmanuel. He saw his victims during nightmares. In 1996  he turned himself in and confessed.\n\n\n\nHis prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003  when Kagame pardoned Hutus who admitted their guilt. After he was freed  he began asking family members of his victims for forgiveness. He joined a group of genocide killers and survivors called Ukurrkuganze  who still meet weekly.\n\n\n\nIt was there that he saw Alice  the woman he thought he had killed.\n\n\n\nAt first he avoided her. Eventually he kneeled before her and asked for forgiveness. After two weeks of thought and long discussions with her husband  she said yes.\n\nIn this March 2014 photo  Rwandans are seen reflected in the windows of an office building go about their daily business. Although Rwanda has made significant progress since the genocide  ethnic tensions remain\n\n'We had attended workshops and trainings and our hearts were kind of free  and I found it easy to forgive ' she says. 'The Bible says you should forgive and you will also be forgiven.'\n\n\n\nJosephine Munyeli is the director of peace and reconciliation programs in Rwanda for World Vision  a U.S.-based aid group. A survivor of the genocide herself  Munyeli says more killers and victims would like to reconcile but many don't know who they attacked or were attacked by.\n\n\n\n'Forgiveness is possible. It's common here ' she says. 'Guilt is heavy. When one realizes how heavy it is the first thing they do to recuperate themselves is apologize.'\n\n\n\nAlthough Rwanda has made significant progress since the genocide  ethnic tensions remain. Alice worries that some genocide planners were never caught  and that messages denying the genocide still filter into the country from Hutus living abroad. She believes remembrance is important to ensure that another genocide never happens.\n\n\n\nFor Emmanuel  the anniversary periods bring back the nightmares. He looks like a man serving penance  who does not want to talk but feels he must.\n\n\n\n'I've been asking myself why I acted like a fool  listening to such words  that this person is bad and that person is bad ' Emmanuel says. 'The same people that encouraged the genocide are the ones saying there was no genocide.'\n\n\n\nHe  too  worries that the embers of the genocide still smolder.\n\n""]",rwandan woman hand chop baby

Gunman kills up to 10 at Walmart - The Namibian,https://www.namibian.com.na/118238/read/Gunman-kills-up-to-10-at-Walmart,"[""A GUNMAN has killed up to 10 people in a Walmart supermarket in Chesapeake  in the US state of Virginia  police officers say.\n\nA man believed to be the store manager opened fire then turned the gun on himself  and is now dead.\n\nThe City of Chesapeake tweeted “police confirm an active shooter incident with fatalities at the Walmart”.\n\nThere are few details  but a police officer spoke of no more than 10 people killed and multiple injured. No motive has emerged. Police told reporters that the attack happened on Tuesday night.\n\nSpokesperson Leo Kosinski said the shooting was believed to have happened inside the store  and that the suspect acted alone.\n\nWalmart said it was “shocked at this tragic event” and that it was “working closely with law enforcement”.\n\nA further update from the police in Chesapeake was expected later yesterday morning. Pictures on social media showed a heavy police presence at the scene  and footage appeared online which appeared to show an eyewitness – wearing Walmart uniform – describing what happened.\n\nHe said he had left a staff room  which a manager then entered and opened fire.\n\n“Sadly  we lost a few of our associates ” the man said  clarifying that he did not know how many of his colleagues were shot.\n\nA spokesperson for Sentara Norfolk General Hospital was quoted by local television station WAVY-TV saying that five people were being treated there.\n\nOne woman told WAVY-TV that her brother  a 20-year-old employee of the shop  was shot just 10 minutes after signing on for work. But she said her sibling was able to talk to relatives and send texts – saying this was “comforting”.\n\nAnother woman named Joetta Jeffery  told CNN that her mother had been inside the building when the attack took place  and had managed to send text messages.\n\nJeffrey said her mother was not hurt but was in shock.\n\nTuesday evening's attack comes just days after a gunman opened fire at a LGBT nightclub in the US state of Colorado  killing five people and injuring 17 others.\n\nIn 2019  a mass shooting at a Walmart in the city of El Paso in Texas left 23 dead. – BBC""]",gunman kill people walmart supermarket chesapeake u state virginia police officer say n na man believe store manager open fire turn gun dead n nthe city chesapeake tweet police confirm active shooter incident fatality walmart n nthere detail police officer speak people kill multiple injured motive emerge police tell reporter attack happen tuesday night n nspokesperson leo kosinski say shoot believe happen inside store suspect act alone n nwalmart say shocked tragic event work closely law enforcement n na update police chesapeake expect later yesterday morning picture social medium show heavy police presence scene footage appear online appear show eyewitness wear walmart uniform describing happen n nhe say left staff room manager enter opened fire n nsadly lose associate man say clarify know many colleague shoot n na spokesperson sentara norfolk general hospital quote local television station wavy tv say five people treat n none woman tell wavy tv brother year old employee shop shot minute sign work say sibling able talk relatives send text say comfort n nanother woman name joetta jeffery tell cnn mother inside build attack take place manage send text message n njeffrey say mother hurt shock n ntuesday even attack come day gunman open fire lgbt nightclub u state colorado kill five people injure others n nin mass shoot walmart city el paso texas leave dead bbc,0.534724687156876,1
"Yes, yes, we have guns. | Travel Blog",https://www.travelblog.org/Africa/Rwanda/Province-du-Sud/blog-274047.html,['Advertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere was a time when Butare  in the south  was on track to become capital of a post-independence Rwanda. Home to the country’s first university  a busy center of intellectual life  it seemed as good a place as any to plant the roots of a new nation. It was  however  buried deep in the south  just a few miles from the border with Burundi  and in the end  Kigali was chosen because of its more favorable  geographically central location.Decades later  with development booming in Kigali  it’s easy to see how the two cities’ fortunes diverged. Butare is small  sluggish  provincial - a rough stretch of souvenir shops and guesthouses on the Kigali road  a handful of auto-part stores and dress shops scattered along a side road looping out toward the market. The drive into town carves through miles of farmland - clusters of banana plants  fields of maize and tea - with tiny hillside villages squatting in the distance. Villagers pass on the side of the road  tall and erect beneath their firewood and bundled banana leaves. It’s hard to imagine that much has changed in these parts in the last few hundred years. A storm blowing across distanthills. The sky darkens; fat drops of rain lash the windows. Outside everyone scurries for cover. In the towns we pass  in front of supermarkets and stationery stores  men and women and children huddle beneath the awnings  grimacing and watching the rain.It’s late in the day when we arrive in Butare  the bus bumping along and sloshing through the mud. The windows are fogged and streaked with rain; outside  under low gray skies  I can just make out the name of my guesthouse receding in the distance. No sooner than we’ve arrived in town  it looks like we’re already leaving it behind. I make a few frantic  obscure gestures toward the front of the bus  and as the only white guy onboard  my panic has a Doppler effect on the rest of the passengers. Soon everyone is hissing and wagging their arms and half-rising in their seats  trying to get the driver’s attention. It’s one of those sweet moments you just don’t get on the Greyhound to Scranton. Finally I’m pacified by one of my neighbors: the bus  he assures me  is only making a stop at the university before returning to the center of town  not farfrom my hotel. I’m grateful for the reassurance  and also for the conversation: before long I’ll realize that English is scarce in Butare  and Jado - a law student at the university - will prove to be a friendly  useful  eloquent guide.During the genocide  Butare was one of the main strongholds of opposition  putting up a valiant resistance against government troops and Hutu militias during those first brutal weeks. But when the city fell  it was with a particular vengeance: by the time the bodies were counted across Rwanda  the region around Butare was one of the country’s hardest hit. More than a decade later  the toll is still visible. Homeless mothers  ragged street kids  amputees vaulting across the potholes on crutches: for a small town  the suffering of Butare seems sadly disproportionate  and for the first time in Rwanda  it becomes an act of great willpower just to leave my hotel - the pretty  tidy  flowery compound of the Hotel Mont Huye - and venture down the street.Admittedly  there’s not much to do in town  and part of my pleasure in being here is just to be somewhere other than Kigali. (Though the drive down too  is worth the three bucks.) After a few days of dodging street kids around the market and knocking back 75cl - 75cl! - bottles of Primus at the Ibis Hotel; after listening to the birds in Mont Huye’s courtyard wreak havoc on the mango trees; after exploring the dirt paths that disappear into lush  ample fields as soon as you leave the main road  I’ve seen most of what Butare has to offer. I take a day-trip to Murambi - a sober  sprawling memorial near Gikongoro - where thousands of bodies have been excavated  blanched by the lime poured into the mass graves. The guide  after showing us into the first corpse-filled room  says there are twenty-four more just like it. But none of us has the stomach to pay our respects to each. There are limits to how much death any of us can stand.Later in the week I meet Jado at the university  a pretty  leafy campus shaded by pine and bamboo and eucalyptus. Tall  flowering trees shake their blossoms onto the pathways; the air smells fresh  earthy. I’m reminded of my own college idyll  tucked away among the oaks and maples  the farmsand cow pastures  of Vermont’s lushly rolling hills. Students are busily milling outside the lecture halls  full of purpose. A few latecomers dash across a field  checking their watches; others gather before a bulletin board  where the latest exam results have been posted. It’s election season in Butare  and campaign posters plaster the walls. Bright  resolute faces stare back from reams of A4. Everyone seems to have somewhere they need to be.We tour the campus  even as the sky darkens and threatens rains  talking about life in America. Jado asks about my family  and for a few moments I’m distracted from thoughts of genocide  from that endless procession of the dead  to think of the sweet  peculiar  fondly recalled dysfunctions of the family life I left behind. The toiling father  a landlord  a frugal cynic  hanging drywall  tinkering with the pipes  doting on his sons to call home. The workhorse mother up at dawn  preparing her lesson plans over fat mugs of Folgers. The brothers in Brooklyn and Buffalo  our lives grown so strangely apart  remembering birthdays  occasional emails  looking so foreign to each other after all the choices  good and bad  behind us. And the long-sufferinggrandmother  fretful  wary  heaving her bosom onto the windowsill to watch the traffic on the street. And the grandfather bitterly waiting out the days in a nursing home. And the cousin not heard from in months. Shake the family tree  and what strange  precious fruits fall! The aunt still alive and kicking. The uncle collapsing on a golf course  rushed to the hospital  pronounced dead on arrival. They filled the church with flowers and well-wishers - everyone had such lovely things to say. It is a good thing to remember and be remembered. We walk quietly under the clouds  under the gathering storm. Jado says he’s a great admirer of Oprah Winfrey. The wind rasps through the treetops  the plump cold raindrops fall fatly over the whole blessed earth.The storm begins to build and we run for shelter. We dash across a football pitch and huddle under the grandstand  listening to the rain pattering off the rusted awning. Quietly I ask Jado about his own family - an invitation to call up memories of the dead  to bring them back for too-brief  bittersweet visits.“I was ten years old during the genocide ” he says  “but I remembereverything - everything - like it just happened yesterday.” The militias began their killings the morning after President Habyarimana’s plane was shot down. “You saw your neighbors in the street with guns  and you were surprised. ‘You? I did not know you had a gun!’” (Guns were officially banned in Rwanda in 1994  though the militias had been stockpiling for months.) “And they would say  ‘Yes  yes  we have guns.’” His eyes grow wide  ominous.Soon afterward he fled from his home in Gisenyi  across the Congo border nearby. The family was scattered. Some survived; many didn’t.“When they came for my brother - this was told to me by my neighbors - they came with machetes and took my younger brother. And he cried and begged them  he said ‘I won’t do it again.’” Jado pauses and laughs bitterly. “Do what? What won’t he do again?” He seems genuinely mystified by this question.That anyone could have survived the slaughter - could have evaded the checkpoints  escaped the militias - is a testament to forces beyond our comprehension. Fate  fortune - call it what you will. Survivors are burdened not only by memories of the dead but by the guilt  the shame of their own inexplicable escapes. Why should a husband be spared when a wife wasn’t? Why should a mother witness the murders of her sons and daughters and live to carry those memories years later?Jado’s father was a truck driver; in the early ‘90s  during the civil war  he was arrested under spurious charges. He spent six months in prison  where he was beaten often. The jailers broke both his legs. “When they brought him home from the prison  they had to carry him ” Jado says  cradling his arms  as if holding a newborn. Yet somehow his father - through luck and guile  through incredible perseverance - escaped the death squads. He is still alive  living in Gisenyi. Jado visits when he can.“He has problems with his memories ” he says. Sometimes the old man will struggle to recognize his son; other times he is terribly  achingly lucid. Brothers and sons  wife and daughters: called up together on a cold  gray  bitter afternoon  a man’s dead can be more than his grief can bear. At what point does forgetting become an act of mercy? For the survivors of the genocide  there is too much remembrance; for many of the perpetrators  forgetting comes all too easy.“These people do not regret ” Jado says of the killers. “They are not ashamed of participating in the genocide. They confess so they can benefit from the amnesty” - an offer made by the Kagame government to induce low-level genocide perpetrators to confess their crimes.“It is not about reconciliation ” he says  with a resignation that suggests that whatever it is about remains elusive.The court system had no way to prosecute all the accused - more than 100 000  by most accounts. With competing demands for justice and reconciliation  the government patched together a practical compromise that  to many survivors  was akin to betrayal. It was a compromise born from political necessity  an acknowledgment of the country’s legal shortcomings  as well as the fear that a decades-long search for justice would just perpetuate the country’s trauma  leaving it locked in an emotional stasis.For survivors  though  the logic was hardly consolation. How could you rebuild a country from so many fractured lives? Reconciliation  in the end  is political shorthand for moving on; and moving on itself implies the act of forgetting - or  at the very least  processing your memories in a way that almost amounts to the same thing. It necessarily places a greater burden on the survivors than the accused. By asking them to accept this flawed justice  to work in the schoolhouse or shop in the market beside the killers of their mothers or husbands or sons  you were making them victims all over again.There is no comprehensible way for an outsider to understand the madness that gripped Rwanda for 100 days in 1994  or to even begin to follow the trail of logic that could ultimately lead to healing. Faced with this impossible task  the government chose to class perpetrators according to the magnitude of their crimes: class I for the politicians and military figures  the architects of the genocide; class II for the local leaders  men respected in their communities  who chose to preside over the infamous road blocks and draw up lists of the condemned  rather than trying to restore peace; class III for the foot soldiers  the men tasked with the bulk of the genocide’s “work.” These men were necessarily followers; many were themselves threatened  forced to make the difficult choice between taking someone else’s life or forfeiting their own. While class I and II criminals were being shipped off to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha  Tanzania  it was the class III perpetrators who would be tried incourts and  ultimately  offered amnesty.Historically  thecourts were small village affairs  used to resolve conflicts between opposing families. The heads of the families would gather in a clearing  or beneath the shade of a hibiscus tree -is Kinyarwanda for “grass” - and reach an equitable verdict. It was a tidy  localized way to settle disputes over land  or bring a thief to justice; it hardly seemed equipped to deal with the legal and ethical implications of a murder trial - or 100 000 of them  for that matter.Under the current Rwandan system  the judges are drawn from the elders and respected leaders of each community. The accused sits before the panel  hearing confessions  answering questions  facing up to whatever ad-hoc justice might be served. But Jado seems unmoved by how much they can accomplish.“Many of these judges are ignorant  they are uneducated  they are corrupt.” He shakes his head. “This is not a perfect justice.”Given the circumstances  it’s impossible to imagine what a “perfect justice” is. Yet it’s just as impossible to imagine why the survivors would demand anything less.Digging through his memories  stirring up the faces of the dead  Jado carries the conversation with great courage. At times  as we pass through crowds  he becomes uncomfortable with words like “Hutu” and “Tutsi” and “genocide.” Soon I’m uncomfortable with them  too  and before long I’ve picked up on the odd shadow language of post-genocide Rwanda. We seem to be talking about everything and nothing at once. Only when we’ve come to a quiet  muddy path - no one else within earshot - does Jado say to me “I can have Hutu friends  I can have Hutu classmates. But a girlfriend?” He shakes his head vigorously. “No no no. No  my family would never allow it.”We follow the path back to the main road. Trucks and buses roar by  bicycles bump over ruts and potholes. Jado is intent on carrying on with his law degree  hoping to practice in Kigali  where a new graduate can expect to earn Rfr 280 000 - more than $500 - a month. Even in the booming capital  that’s enough to live reasonably well. With time  he should be able to make double that.His prospects are good  yet there’s no telling what the future holds. Still  Jado remains insistent. “There can never be reconciliation without justice ” he says  bitterly implying that  in our imperfect world  the smart bet is to expect neither.'],advertisement n n n

Body of Ugandan shot dead in Rwanda repatriated - The Observer,https://observer.ug/news/headlines/63297-body-of-ugandan-shot-dead-in-rwanda-repatriated,"['The body of a Ugandan national  Teojen Ndagijimana recently shot dead last week by Rwandan security operatives has been brought back into the country.\n\n\n\nNdagijimana  25  a resident of Kabingo village  Murora sub-county in Kisoro district was shot dead on Saturday at Kumugu trading centre Musanze district in Rwanda  about three kilometres away from the Ugandan border.\n\n\n\nNdagijmana was shot together with two Rwandans  Erike Biizimana and Emmanuel Mbabazi - all residents of Burera in Rwanda. According to residents  Ndagijimana and his brother identified as Augustine Gatsiri had crossed to Rwanda through the porous border to smuggle into Rwanda tea bags.\n\n\n\nEach of them was carrying a sack containing teabags worth 35 kilograms. Ndagijmana\'s body was handed over today Wednesday to Ugandan authorities at Chanika border at around 12:30 pm amidst tight security from both countries.The body was taken to Chahafi health centre IV for post-mortem.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurera district mayor  Marie Chantal Uwanyirigira and senior superintendent of police  Jean Bosco Rudasingwa led the Rwandan delegation while Uganda’s delegation was led by Captain Peter Mugisha  Kisoro resident district commissioner  Ruhunde Christopher and James Nsaba Buturo the MP for Bujumbura County East.\n\n\n\nRwandan security operatives had reportedly planned to hand over the body yesterday Tuesday night at around 10:00 pm  but Ugandan authorities rejected the move  questioning the motive of handing over the body in darkness.\n\n\n\nWhile handing over the body  Uwanyirigira said that although the shooting incident is unfortunate  Ugandans must desist from crossing to Rwanda through porous borders because Rwandan security have orders that they will follow to the latter. She said that Rwandan laws strongly prohibit smuggling and drug trafficking.\n\n""We’re sorry as Rwandans  it was not a planned action because we’re friends and the only message I can tell all Rwandans and Ugandans is to respect the order from Rwanda and all countries. In Rwanda  it is not allowed to use drugs and transport drugs. It is not allowed. Also  smuggling is not good and the only reason [they were shot] is because when they have been arrested by our security officials  they tried to be aggressive towards our security organs. It was a way of handling the case because they wanted to kill our security organs. The incident took place when he was with two people from Rwanda and the Rwandans are also dead. But next time it is good to respect the order we have."" said Uwanyirigira.\n\nCaptain Mugisha urged Ugandans to remain calm and not retaliate in any form despite being annoyed at the shootings since Rwanda closed its border to Uganda in February 2019. In November last year  Rwandan security officials also shot and killed two Ugandans John Bosco Tuhirirwe  30  a resident of Nyakabungo village in Kyabihangwa parish and Job Byarushaga  37 for illegally crossing into Rwanda.\n\nEarlier in May 2019  John Batista Ncherengye  a Rwandan national and Alex Nyesiga Atuheire  a Ugandan national and resident of Nyakabungo village in Rukiga district in western Uganda were shot dead admittedly by Rwandan security officers from inside Ugandan territory.\n\n""People are not happy and will not be happy. You cannot lose your beloved one and become happy. Let us first burry then we shall come back to sit with the LCs in meetings to see how best we can handle the situation since the government is handling the situation government to government. For us  we’re going to handle the situation as locals. But I tell them not to be so annoyed to the level of fighting."" said Mugisha.\n\nUgandans stage a peaceful protest at the Uganda-Rwanda border following the killing of Teojen Ndagijimana\n\nEver since Rwanda closed its borders with Uganda to purportedly expedite the construction of the single customs at Gatuna border tensions between the two countries have hit pitch high. Several delegations and meetings set out by either country have failed to resolve the outstanding issues and the mantle has now been passed unto Presidents Yoweri Museveni and Paul Kagame.\n\nThe presidents  it had been reported were set to hold talks in London  during the UK-Africa Investment Summit this week but no further communication has since come out of both camps to suggest that the meeting indeed took place. Kagame accuses Ugandan authorities of abducting Rwandan citizens and locking them up in ungazetted areas.\n\nHe also accuses Uganda of hosting and facilitating dissidents especially Rwanda National Congress and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda  who have declared war on the Kigali government.\n\nRwanda advised its citizens against travelling to Uganda  saying it can\'t guarantee their safety and even those seeking education  food and health services have been blocked.

Two Ugandan smugglers shot dead in Rwanda - The Observer,https://observer.ug/news/headlines/62584-two-ugandan-smugglers-shot-dead-in-rwanda,"['Two Ugandan men have been shot dead in Rwanda.\n\nJohn Bosco Tuhirirwe  30  a resident of Nyakabungo village in Kyabihangwa parish and Job Byarushaga  37  a resident of Kiruhura village  Kamwezi in Rukiga district were shot dead on Sunday morning at around 5:00 am at Nyagatare district  Rwanda about 200 metres from the Ugandan border.\n\n\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses  the deceased together with three others identified as Aron Ainebyoona  Christopher Byamukama and Emmanuel Niwamanya were smuggling tobacco using bicycles from Kamwezi to Rwanda.\n\n\n\nThey had crossed into Rwanda through a porous border of Mproro commonly known as Busia. Byamukama  one of the survivors says that they were first intercepted by Local Defense operatives and quizzed why they had crossed into Rwanda.\n\nByamukama says that as they tried to plead for forgiveness but the operatives alerted security officials from Nyagatare. Byamukama says that security operatives from Nyagatare started shooting at them killing Tuhirirwe and Byarishanga on spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nByamukama says that the Byarishanga was shot twice while Turirirwe was shot once in the chest. Byamukama says that they abandoned their bicycles and fled back to Uganda.\n\n\n\nJackson Muganiizi  Rukiga LC V vice chairman  who is also the district councilor representing Kamwezi sub county says that after shooting  Rwandan security operatives wrapped the bodies in sacks and carried them to Nyagatare.\n\n""People are being killed in Rwanda and we’re normally hearing that even Rwandans [crossing into Uganda] are being shot day and night. But the incident of this night is really terrible because we were getting used to interacting with them [again]. Those coming to get something to eat or drink."" said Muganiizi.\n\n\n\nRwanda closed its borders with Uganda in February 2019 to purportedly expedite the construction of the single customs at Gatuna border. The borders have remained closed since but there have been positive talks between the Kigali and Kampala governments. Rwanda President Paul Kagame then accused Ugandan authorities of abducting its citizens and locking them up in ungazetted areas.\n\nRwanda also accused Uganda of hosting and facilitating dissidents especially Rwanda National Congress and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda  who have declared war on the Kigali government. Rwanda advised its citizens against travelling to Uganda  saying it can\'t guarantee their safety.']",two ugandan men shoot dead rwanda n njohn bosco tuhirirwe resident nyakabungo village kyabihangwa parish job byarushaga resident kiruhura village kamwezi rukiga district shot dead sunday morning around nyagatare district rwanda metre ugandan border n n n naccording eyewitness decease together three others identify aron ainebyoona christopher byamukama emmanuel niwamanya smuggle tobacco use bicycle kamwezi rwanda n n n nthey cross rwanda porous border mproro commonly know busia byamukama one survivor say first intercepted local defense operative quiz crossed rwanda n nbyamukama say try plead forgiveness operative alert security official nyagatare byamukama say security operative nyagatare start shoot kill tuhirirwe byarishanga spot n n n n n nbyamukama say byarishanga shot twice turirirwe shot chest byamukama say abandon bicycle flee back uganda n n n njackson muganiizi rukiga lc v vice chairman also district councilor represent kamwezi sub county say shoot rwandan security operative wrap body sack carry nyagatare n n people kill rwanda normally hear even rwandan cross uganda shot day night incident night really terrible get used interact come get something eat drink say muganiizi n n n nrwanda close border uganda february purportedly expedite construction single custom gatuna border border remain closed since positive talk kigali kampala government rwanda president paul kagame accuse ugandan authority abduct citizen lock ungazetted area n nrwanda also accuse uganda host facilitate dissident especially rwanda national congress democratic force liberation rwanda declare war kigali government rwanda advise citizen travel uganda say guarantee safety,0.8065098922775868,1
"Hutu rebels drop guns, return to Rwanda - CSMonitor.com",https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2009/0220/p06s04-woaf.html,"['Joseph Karege wanted to give up his gun and come back to Rwanda long before the tide turned against him and his fellow Hutu militiamen.\n\nUntil last week  Mr. Karege was a member of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)  a Rwandan Hutu militia accused of committing the 1994 genocide of more than 800 000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Millions of Hutus  afraid of reprisals  fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo just as the genocide ended; they have been hiding in the inhospitable jungle there ever since.\n\nLast month  Rwanda – which considers the FDLR an existential threat – announced it had sent troops into Congo to get the rebels out once and for all.\n\nWorking together with the Congolese army  the combined troops launched a joint military offensive against the FDLR  hoping to drive the remaining 6 000 fighters out of the bush and across the border to Rwanda  where the Tutsi-dominated government promises them a fair chance at a new life.\n\nAs the operation nears its end – Congolese officials have said the Rwandan soldiers must leave by Feb. 28 – the numbers suggest it may be working.\n\nPace of surrender quickens\n\nMore than 320 former FDLR soldiers have been disarmed since the joint mission started on Jan. 20  according to numbers from the UN mission in Congo  known by its French acronym  MONUC. That\'s roughly half of the number who deserted in all of 2008. More than 620 of their family members have been sent back to Rwanda.\n\nKarege was among the earliest deserters. It\'s true more people are leaving their guns behind  he says  but not because they\'re scared of the joint offensive. They\'re coming back  he and others say  because the offensive is creating the kind of chaos needed for a successful escape from a rebel group that threatens its foot soldiers with death if they try to desert.\n\nFDLR deserters brave death to flee\n\n""It has nothing to do with fear of the gunshots being fired [by Rwanda] now."" Karege says. ""I always wanted to come back.... But once you desert  if you get caught  you are shot. War provided the room to maneuver....""\n\nKarege was one of 44 former FDLR fighters who returned to Rwanda early last week. They filed off the bus in the Mutobo reintegration camp near Ruhengeri  in Rwanda  with things in tow – suitcases  jerry cans  even a mattress. Their luggage is a sign  they say  that the FDLR is changing in response to Rwandan troops.\n\n""Before the war  there was no way we would carry a bag "" says Emmanuel Hitimana  who had been in Congo since 1994. ""We used to have a front line. We would fight from that line  while we left our family behind  at a base. Now  the base has disappeared.... People are fighting as they are moving. We have the guns  and the women have the bags.""\n\nMr. Hitimana says the fighters travel with their families because they\'re afraid of the Congolese troops  who have been displaying a boost in confidence since teaming up with the Rwandans in late January.\n\n""If you go to fight  you come back to find that the Congolese [troops] have attacked your family "" he says. ""The Congolese have always feared the FDLR very much. One FLDR soldier could stop 20 Congolese. Now  attacking FDLR families is their way of saying  \'We can also do something.\' ""\n\nHitimana says he has been trying to leave eastern Congo for two years. He sent three of his children to Rwanda for school; last year  he was imprisoned for a week by the FDLR  which suspected him of wanting to desert. Last week  he escaped to MONUC with his wife and their year-old child as the Rwandans were closing in.\n\n""We looked for MONUC because we couldn\'t trust the Rwandan army "" he says. ""They\'re armed  so it was risky.... We are getting shot at on both sides—by the FDLR  and by the Rwandan troops.""\n\nAs the threat of battle with the Rwandans looms  the FDLR have gotten increasingly brutal  according to human rights observers.\n\nRoughly 100 Congolese civilians have been massacred by the FDLR since the joint operations began  says Anneke Van Woudenberg  an Africa adviser at Human Rights Watch.\n\n""The vast majority [of murders] were as the coalition of Rwandan and Congolese forces were approaching Kibua  which was one of the main military bases of the FDLR "" she says. ""They started to turn against local population  blocking them from fleeing  actually abducting them … and taking them to a military base … and keeping them as human shields.""\n\nOthers  she says  were shot  hacked to death with machetes  or hit with heavy weapons fire  including a rocket-propelled grenade. It\'s a level of ""ghastly"" violence she says hasn\'t been seen in years.\n\nThe rights group also heard reports of Rwandan troops raping Congolese women and girls near Kibua. One woman told the group that Rwandan soldiers accused her of being FDLR because she was Hutu  and then raped her.\n\nRwandan troops last fought in Congo during the 1998-2002 war  during which it aimed to wipe out the FDLR.\n\n6 000 fighters still in the bush\n\nThough the UN says the increase in deserters suggests that this time  the Rwandan presence may be working  some observers say desertion numbers aren\'t everything. There are still more than 6 000 fighters in the bush  and less than two weeks officially left of the joint operation.\n\nPhilip Lancaster  who ran the UN\'s demobilization efforts in eastern Congo until October  says the numbers might also suggest the FDLR are moving their families to safety in preparation for a major battle with the Rwandans. While Rwanda has reported killing upwards of 100 FDLR since the operations began  so far there\'s been no major military confrontation between the two forces.\n\nMr. Lancaster says that means it\'s too early to conclude that individual desertions show the FDLR is giving up  especially if the force commanders stay in the bush.\n\n""I don\'t think the numbers mean anything "" Lancaster says. ""To see a single commander [surrender] with a group  that\'s an indicator something is changing.""\n\nThe Rwandan Demobilization and Reintegration Commission calls the repatriation rates average. Coordinator Frank Musoni says the reintegration camps  where former FDLR fighters spend two months learning about life in Rwanda  are working well under capacity at their two sites  in Mutobo and Muhazi.\n\n""We expect the joint operation to bring bigger numbers  but as of yet  we haven\'t seen anything exciting "" he says. ""Exciting numbers would be 1 000 in [the Mutobo camp] and 2 000 in [the Muhazi camp]. Then I would have something to say  yes  this is working.""\n\nFormer combatants in Mutobo say that no one guilty of genocide will surrender.\n\n""We came voluntarily  but other people will come [only] by force. They will come injured and in handcuffs "" says Karege. ""That\'s how we will know the difference.""']",joseph karege want give gun come back rwanda long tide turn fellow hutu militiaman n nuntil last week mr karege member democratic force liberation rwanda fdlr rwandan hutu militia accuse commit genocide tutsi moderate hutu million hutu afraid reprisal flee democratic republic congo genocide end hide inhospitable jungle ever since n nlast month rwanda considers fdlr existential threat announce sent troop congo get rebel n nworking together congolese army combine troop launch joint military offensive fdlr hop drive remain fighter bush across border rwanda tutsi dominate government promise fair chance new life n nas operation nears end congolese official say rwandan soldier must leave feb number suggest may work n npace surrender quickens n nmore former fdlr soldier disarm since joint mission start jan accord number un mission congo know french acronym monuc roughly half number desert family member send back rwanda n nkarege among early deserter true people leave gun behind say scar joint offensive come back others say offensive create kind chaos need successful escape rebel group threaten foot soldier death try desert n nfdlr deserter brave death flee n n nothing fear gunshot fire rwanda karege say always want come back desert get catch shot war provide room maneuver n nkarege one former fdlr fighter return rwanda early last week file bus mutobo reintegration camp near ruhengeri rwanda thing tow suitcase jerry can even mattress luggage sign say fdlr change response rwandan troop n n war way would carry bag say emmanuel hitimana congo since use front line would fight line leave family behind base base disappear people fight move gun woman bag n nmr hitimana say fighter travel family afraid congolese troop display boost confidence since team rwandan late january n n go fight come back find congolese troop attack family say congolese always fear fdlr much one fldr soldier could stop congolese attack fdlr family way say also something n nhitimana say try leave eastern congo two year send three child rwanda school last year imprison week fdlr suspect want desert last week escape monuc wife year old child rwandans close n n look monuc trust rwandan army say arm risky get shot sidesby fdlr rwandan troop n nas threat battle rwandans looms fdlr get increasingly brutal accord human right observer n nroughly congolese civilian massacre fdlr since joint operation begin say anneke van woudenberg africa adviser human right watch n n vast majority murder coalition rwandan congolese force approach kibua one main military base fdlr say start turn local population block flee actually abduct take military base keep human shield n nothers say shot hack death machete hit heavy weapon fire include rocket propel grenade level ghastly violence say see year n nthe right group also hear report rwandan troop rap congolese woman girl near kibua one woman tell group rwandan soldier accuse fdlr hutu rap n nrwandan troop last fought congo war aim wipe fdlr n n fighter still bush n nthough un say increase deserter suggest time rwandan presence may work observer say desertion number everything still fighters bush less two week officially leave joint operation n nphilip lancaster run un demobilization effort eastern congo october say number might also suggest fdlr move family safety preparation major battle rwandans rwanda report kill upwards fdlr since operation begin far major military confrontation two force n nmr lancaster say mean early conclude individual desertion show fdlr give especially force commander stay bush n n think number mean anything lancaster say see single commander surrender group indicator something change n nthe rwandan demobilization reintegration commission call repatriation rate average coordinator frank musoni say reintegration camp former fdlr fighter spend two month learn life rwanda work well capacity two site mutobo muhazi n n expect joint operation bring big number yet see anything excite say exciting number would mutobo camp muhazi camp would something say yes work n nformer combatant mutobo say one guilty genocide surrender n n come voluntarily people come force come injure handcuff say karege know difference,0.52894931741143,1
Six officers who fired guns during 2020 fatal police shooting in ...,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2022/11/10/six-officers-who-fired-guns-during-2020-fatal-police-shooting-in-richmond-used-reasonable-force-wont-be-charged/,['MARTINEZ — Six officers who fired their guns when Richmond and Oakland police shot and killed a man two years ago in Richmond showed reasonable action and will not be charged with any wrongdoing  authorities said Thursday.\n\nFive Oakland police officers and one officer from Richmond shot at Juan Carlos Ayon-Barraza  24  of Vallejo  after he had been reported to have attacked a woman and dumped her in the East Bay hills two years ago. Barraza was fatally wounded in the gunfire. The woman died weeks later.\n\nContra Costa County District Attorney Diana Becton announced the decision in a statement after the office conducted its own investigation into the shooting  per protocol. Prosecutors have the burden of proving a death at the hands of police is not justified.\n\nRichmond police Ofc. Joe DeOrian fired more than one shot at Barraza  authorities said. Oakland police Officers Michael Finnicum  Benjamin Sarno  Kyle Gaskin  Robert Recendez  and Matthew Hohn all fired at least one shot  authorities said.\n\nIt all happened on April 16  2020  starting about 6:45 p.m. Authoriites said a bicyclist saw Ayon-Barraza trying to push Thomas over the edge of the roadway while she was wrapped in a blanket or towels near the unincorporated town of Canyon  close to the border of Contra Costa and Alameda counties. It ended about 7:30 p.m. at South 37th Street and Stege Avenue in Richmond  where officers fired the fatal shots.\n\nBefore that deadly shootout  authorities said  Ayon-Barraza also rammed the van he drove into a patrol car  causing one officer to be hit by the van and the other to be trapped inside his vehicle. Both recovered.\n\nThe ramming of the patrol vehicle and the shooting were captured on police video footage.\n\n“In a legal analysis of the case  the District Attorney’s Office applied the applicable laws and the California District Attorney’s Uniform Crime Charging Standards to review the evidence of the incident ” Becton said in her statement. “The concluding opinion determined the use of deadly force by the peace officers against (Ayon-Barraza) was reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances.”\n\nOakland police officers had pursued Ayon-Barraza after the bicyclist spotted him dumping gravely wounded 29-year-old Tamisha Thomas.\n\nAuthorities said Ayon-Barraza attacked and kidnapped Thomas from Vallejo earlier that day. Thomas’ family earlier had contacted police to file a missing persons report on her  police said. In it  the family said Thomas last had been seen with Ayon-Barraza.\n\nWhen a family member later confronted him about the disappearance  authorities said Ayon-Barraza said “something bad” had happened to her. He then took off in a vehicle  authorities said.\n\nSoon after the bicyclist called 911  Oakland police officers spotted Ayon-Barraza in a car near the junction of Highways 13 and 24  heading toward Interstate 580. They pursued him through Oakland city streets  back onto Interstate 580 and eventually into Richmond.\n\nThomas initially survived her injuries but died in an Oakland hospital more than a month later. She left behind a young son.\n\nAyon-Barraza had a history of domestic violence arrests  including a case in Contra Costa County where he allegedly held a knife to a woman’s throat while demanding a sex act in the same room where her children were sleeping. He accepted a plea deal to a lesser offense in that case  but had an active arrest warrant for failing to complete domestic violence classes at the time of his death.'],martinez six officer fire gun richmond oakland police shot kill man two year ago richmond show reasonable action charge wrongdoing authority say thursday n nfive oakland police officer one officer richmond shot juan carlos ayon barraza vallejo report attacked woman dump east bay hill two year ago barraza fatally wound gunfire woman die week later n ncontra costa county district attorney diana becton announce decision statement office conduct investigation shoot per protocol prosecutor burden prove death hand police justified n nrichmond police ofc joe deorian fire one shot barraza authority say oakland police officer michael finnicum benjamin sarno kyle gaskin robert recendez matthew hohn fire least one shot authority say n nit happen april start p authoriites say bicyclist saw ayon barraza try push thomas edge roadway wrap blanket towel near unincorporated town canyon close border contra costa alameda county end p south th street stege avenue richmond officer fire fatal shot n nbefore deadly shootout authority say ayon barraza also ram van drive patrol car cause one officer hit van trap inside vehicle recover n nthe ram patrol vehicle shoot capture police video footage n nin legal analysis case district attorney office apply applicable law california district attorney uniform crime charging standard review evidence incident becton say statement conclude opinion determine use deadly force peace officer ayon barraza reasonable base totality circumstance n noakland police officer pursue ayon barraza bicyclist spot dump gravely wound year old tamisha thomas n nauthorities say ayon barraza attack kidnap thomas vallejo earlier day thomas family earlier contacted police file miss person report police say family say thomas last see ayon barraza n nwhen family member later confront disappearance authority say ayon barraza say something bad happen take vehicle authority say n nsoon bicyclist call oakland police officer spot ayon barraza car near junction highway head toward interstate pursued oakland city street back onto interstate eventually richmond n nthomas initially survive injury die oakland hospital month later leave behind young son n nayon barraza history domestic violence arrest include case contra costa county allegedly hold knife woman throat demand sex act room child sleep accept plea deal less offense case active arrest warrant fail complete domestic violence class time death,0.5239118185844667,1

Brennan Linsley of Associated Press reports from Kigali on the latest atrocity.\n\nSuspected Hutu rebels attacked a camp for Tutsi refugees in north-western Rwanda yesterday  killing as many as 200 people.\n\nThe attackers raided about 100 tents in the camp  which houses several thousand refugees from the Masisi area in neighbouring Congo  according to Paula Ghedini  spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Rwandan military put the death toll at 230.\n\nThe marauders used hand grenades  machetes and guns during the 15-minute  early morning raid  said Colonel Kayumba Nyamwasa  a regional commander of Rwanda\'s Tutsi-led army.\n\nCol Kayumba said soldiers had been unable to repel the attackers  who fled into Congo after the slaughter.The UNHCR requested medical supplies for about 200 wounded being treated at the hospital in Gisenyi  about 100 km north-west of the capital  Kigali.\n\nIt was the second attack on Mudende camp since August  when more than 100 refugees were killed during a raid blamed on Hutu rebels.\n\nThe refugees had fled the Masisi region in mid-1996 to escape attacks by Hutu rebels  who were then based at the refugee camps in eastern Zaire  since renamed Congo.\n\nAuthorities say the rebels  responsible for the deaths of 500 000 minority Tutsis in Rwanda\'s 1994 Hutu genocide  have mixed with more than 1 million Hutu civilians who returned to Rwanda late last year.\n\nRwanda\'s Tutsi-led government blames the rebels for a surge in violence in the north-western corner of Rwanda. Barely a week passes without a rebel ambush or an attack on a jail.\n\nYesterday\'s attack coincided with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\'s one-day visit to Kigali  where she met President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Paul Kagame.\n\nMs Albright said: ""There is clearly room for improvement in the human rights record for Rwanda. Given the history of the genocide ... we understand how difficult it must be for them. A lot has been done already [to improve human rights] but they have a long way to go.""\n\nMs Albright said the US was determined to help Rwanda come to terms with the aftermath of the 1994 genocide.']",free real time break news alert send straight inbox sign break news email sign free break news email please enter valid email address please enter valid email address sign would like emailed offer event updates independent read privacy notice thanks sign n nbreaking news email verifyerrors message verifyerrors verifyerrors something go wrong please try late verifyerrors n nhutu rebel rwanda appear step attack tutsi survivor genocide brennan linsley associate press report kigali late atrocity n nsuspected hutu rebel attack camp tutsi refugee north western rwanda yesterday kill many people n nthe attacker raid tent camp house several thousand refugee masisi area neighbour congo accord paula ghedini spokeswoman unite nation high commissioner refugee rwandan military put death toll n nthe marauder use hand grenade machete gun minute early morning raid say colonel kayumba nyamwasa regional commander rwanda tutsi lead army n ncol kayumba say soldier unable repel attacker flee congo slaughter unhcr request medical supply wound treated hospital gisenyi km north west capital kigali n nit second attack mudende camp since august refugee kill raid blame hutu rebel n nthe refugee flee masisi region mid escape attack hutu rebel base refugee camp eastern zaire since rename congo n nauthorities say rebel responsible death minority tutsi rwanda hutu genocide mixed million hutu civilian return rwanda late last year n nrwanda tutsi lead government blame rebel surge violence north western corner rwanda barely week pass without rebel ambush attack jail n nyesterday attack coincide u secretary state madeleine albright one day visit kigali meet president pasteur bizimungu vice president paul kagame n nm albright say clearly room improvement human right record rwanda give history genocide understand difficult must lot do already improve human right long way go n nms albright say u determine help rwanda come term aftermath genocide,0.5260172164681562,1
